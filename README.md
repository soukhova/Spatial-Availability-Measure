# About

The goal of this project is to contrast the differences, boundaries, and
improvements of a newly proposed accessibility measure we call **spatial
availability**. Through the example of Worker Origin to Job Destination
Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data in the City of Toronto,
conventional accessibility to jobs is calculated alongside the proposed
spatially **available** accessibility to jobs measure.

Associated data and a function for **spatial availability** is available
in a data-package called ‘JobsAvailable-TTS16’ ([*work in
progress*](https://github.com/soukhova/JobsAvailable-TTS16)). This
data-package, includes the TTS origins, TTS destinations, number of jobs
and workers at origin and destination, travel times by car (calculated
via [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r)), the **spatial
availability** function, and a developed vignette demonstrating a toy
example.
