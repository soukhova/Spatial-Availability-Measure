# Shen's Example:

This is the example from Shen (1998, p. 349):
![Shen's example](shen-example.jpg)

Code data:
```{r}
od_tt <- data.frame(o_id = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C"), # Three origins
                    d_id = c("1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3"), # Three destinations
                    tt = c(15, 30, 100, 30, 15, 100, 100, 100, 15), # Travel time
                    pop = c(50000, 50000, 50000, 150000, 150000, 150000, 10000, 10000, 10000), # Population
                    opp = c(100000, 100000, 10000, 100000, 100000, 10000, 100000, 100000, 10000)) # Jobs
```

Use an exponential impedance function as follows:
$$
f(c_{ij}) = exp(-b\cdot c_{ij})
$$

Set b:
```{r}
b <- 0.00001
```


Calculate impedance:
```{r}
od_tt <- od_tt |>
  mutate(f = exp(-b * tt))
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility is calculated as:
$$
S_i = \sum_jO_jf(c_{ij})
$$
This is the estimate of conventional accessibility:
```{r}
S <- od_tt |>
  group_by(o_id) |>
  summarize(S = sum(opp * f),
            .groups = "drop")
S
```

## Shen's accessibility with congestion

In this case accessibility is calculated as:
$$
A_i = \sum_j \frac{O_jf(c_{ij})}{D_j}
$$

\noindent with:
$$
D_j = \sum_kP_kf(c_{jk})
$$


As an alternative we can define a new variable level of service as follows:
$$
LOS_j = \frac{O_j}{D_j}
$$

\noindent which then would give:
$$
A_i = \sum_j LOS_jf(c_{ij})
$$

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r}

data.frame(tt = seq(0,100,5)) %>% mutate(f=exp(-b*tt)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=tt, y=f)) + geom_line()
```


First calculate the level of service:
=======
First calculate the level of service (demand by destination):
>>>>>>> 48e32d7dd6f3518d5c5dc38877416c9eb7351ff0
```{r}
LOS_j <- od_tt |>
  group_by(d_id) |>
  summarize(opp = first(opp),
            D_j = sum(pop * f),
            .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(LOS_j = opp/D_j)

LOS_j
```

Check the calculation of D_j:
```{r}
50000 * exp(-b * 15) + 150000 * exp(-b * 30) + 10000 * exp(-b * 100)
50000 * exp(-b * 30) + 150000 * exp(-b * 15) + 10000 * exp(-b * 100)
50000 * exp(-b * 100) + 150000 * exp(-b * 100) + 10000 * exp(-b * 15)
```

**IMPORTANT:** The demand is _less_ than the population!
```{r}
LOS_j |>
  pull(D_j) |>
  sum()
```

Compare to the actual population:
```{r}
od_tt |>
  distinct(o_id, 
           .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  pull(pop) |>
  sum()
```

Demand by _origin_:
```{r}
D_i <- od_tt |>
  group_by(o_id) |>
  summarize(D_i = sum(pop * f),
            .groups = "drop")

D_i
sum(D_i$D_i)
```


This is problematic: the impedance function says that workers are willing to travel only so far, that many of them are not actually willing to travel to take a job. In other words, the travel behavior indicates a shortage of labor of:
```{r}
od_tt |>
  distinct(o_id, 
           .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  pull(pop) |>
  sum() - LOS_j |>
  pull(D_j) |>
  sum()
```

Join demand to table:
```{r}
A <- od_tt %>%
  left_join(LOS_j |>
              dplyr::select(d_id, LOS_j),
            by = "d_id")

A
```

Calculate accessibility:
```{r}
A <- A |>
  group_by(o_id) |>
  summarize(A = sum(LOS_j * f))

A
```

Shen's property says that the weighted sum of accessibility (by total population) equals the number of opportunities:
```{r}
A |>
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * c(50000,
                              150000,
                              10000)) |>
  pull(nominal_jobs)

A |>
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * c(50000,
                              150000,
                              10000)) |>
  pull(nominal_jobs) |>
  sum()
```

Center A is sending 66 thousand workers but only 50,000 are there, etc. When accessibility is greater than 1 this happens. But these extra people don't exist so you cant use this to forecast congestion/infrastructure impacts on the network. This can't be used for infrastructure planning because the populations are 'potential' supply and 'potential' demand.


This calculation is not consistent with the travel behavior of the population. For center a: 1.33 jobs per worker - but that was calculated assuming 66833 jobs per 50250.38 potential workers.  We know that the _demand_ for jobs is less than the total population so it doesn't actually allocate ALL the jobs... it only allocates some of the jobs based on the travel behaviour. What's the value of this property if it tells you that there are 210,000 jobs... but only ends up giving out the sum of D_j (~57,000). It's only a proof a certain constraint and it is not really useful for us. 

Accordingly the number of jobs _according to the demand by zone_ is:
```{r}
# Workers traveling for jobs from each zone
A |>
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * D_i$D_i) |>
  pull(nominal_jobs)

A |>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * LOS_j$D_j) |>
  pull(nominal_jobs) |>
  sum()
```
The logical inconsistency is if you disregard the travel behaviour assumption () then you can get the total number of jobs. But, if you are oncisstent with travel behaviour not all jobs are taken. 

Imagine that 15 mins = 150,000km. It's so far people are not willing to go there. So .06 people of 210,000 people will go to take these jobs (when beta is 1). So this property, where all the jobs are preserved, masks that people don't have the willingness to travel. I.e., in center A, 1.99 jobs per worker but it is out of the 0.03 workers who seek all the 0.06 jobs.

Nominal number of jobs (total):
```{r}
A |>
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * c(50000,
                              150000,
                              10000)) |>
=======
  mutate(nominal_jobs = A * D_i$D_i) |>
>>>>>>> 48e32d7dd6f3518d5c5dc38877416c9eb7351ff0
  pull(nominal_jobs) |>
  sum()
```

# Spatial availability

Function to calculate spatial availability:
```{r sp_avail-function,include=FALSE}
#defining the spatial availability function
sp_avail <- function(x, o_id, d_id, pop, opp, r, f, alpha = 1){

  o_id <- rlang::enquo(o_id)
  d_id <- rlang::enquo(d_id)
  pop <- rlang::enquo(pop)
  opp <- rlang::enquo(opp)
  r <- rlang::enquo(r)
  f <- rlang::enquo(f)

  sum_pop <- x %>%
    dplyr::distinct(!!o_id,
                    .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(sum_pop = !!r*(!!pop)^alpha) %>%
    dplyr::pull(sum_pop) %>%
    sum()

  f_p <- dplyr::pull(x, !!r) * dplyr::pull(x, !!pop)^alpha / sum_pop

  sum_impedance <- x %>%
    dplyr::group_by(!!d_id) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(sum_impedance = sum(!!f))

  x <- x %>%
    dplyr::left_join(sum_impedance,
                     by = rlang::as_name(d_id))

  f_c <- dplyr::pull(x, !!f) / x$sum_impedance

  x$f_c <- f_c
  x$f_p <- f_p

  sum_pa <- x %>%
    dplyr::group_by(!!d_id) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(sum_pa= sum(f_p * f_c))

  x <- x %>%
    dplyr::left_join(sum_pa,
                     by = rlang::as_name(d_id))
  f_t <- (f_p * f_c) / dplyr::pull(x, sum_pa)

  dplyr::pull(x, !!opp) * f_t
}
```

Calculate spatial availability:
```{r}
V_i <- od_tt %>%
  mutate(r = 1) %>%
  mutate(V_ij = sp_avail(.,
                        o_id = o_id, 
                        d_id = d_id, 
                        pop = pop, 
                        opp = opp, 
                        r = r, 
                        f = f, 
                        alpha = 1))
V_i
```

Total number of jobs available:
```{r}
V_i |>
  pull(V_ij) |>
  sum()
```

Jobs available per origin:
```{r}
V_i |>
  group_by(o_id) |>
  summarize(V_i = sum(V_ij),
            .groups = "drop")
```

Jobs per capita per origin:
```{r}
V_i |>
  group_by(o_id) |>
  summarize(V_i = sum(V_ij),
            .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(v_i = V_i / c(50000, 150000, 10000)) |>
  pull(v_i)
