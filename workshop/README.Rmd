## Abstract

Accessibility measures are widely used in transportation, urban and healthcare planning, among other applications. These measures are weighted sums of the opportunities that can be reached given the cost of movement and are interpreted to represent the potential for spatial interaction. Though these measures are useful in understanding spatial structure, their methodologies count available opportunities multiple times. This leads to interpretability issues, as noted in recent research on balanced floating catchment areas (BFCA) and competitive measures of accessibility. In this paper, we respond to the limitations of the accessibility measure by proposing a new measure of  _spatial availability_ which is calculated by imposing a single constraint on the conventional gravity-based accessibility. Similar to the gravity model from which spatial availability is derived, a single constraint ensures that the marginals at the destination are met and thus the number of opportunities are preserved. Through examples, we detail the formulation of the proposed measure. Further, we use data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area in southern Ontario, Canada, to contrast how the conventional accessibility measure tends to overestimate and underestimate the number of jobs _available_ to workers. We conclude with some discussion of the possible uses of spatial availability and argue that, compared to conventional measures of accessibility, it can offer a more meaningful and interpretable measure of opportunity access. All data and code used in this research are openly available.

![](images/Image-16.png)

![](images/Image-17.png)

Formalizing this, we see that spatial availability $V_i$ is the weighted, and _constrained_, sum of opportunities:
$$
V_i = \sum_j^J O_j\frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_n^N f(c_{nj})}
$$

\noindent where:

- $N$ is the number of locations where population is
- $J$ is the number of locations where opportunities are

Compare to accessibility:
$$
S_i = \sum_j^JO_jf(c_{ij})
$$

Let us change the set up to illustrate a different point.

![](images/Image-18.png)

![](images/Image-19.png)

When we formalize this we see again that _spatial availability_ is a weighted sum of the opportunities, constrained to match the total:

$$
V_i = \sum_j O_j\frac{P_i}{\sum_n^N P_n}
$$

We have described two proportional allocation mechanisms:

1. By the cost of interaction (through the impedance function)

1. By the size of the population

These are consistent with the principles of spatial interaction (e.g., the gravity model):

1. The friction of space

1. The importance of size (mass)

We call these quantities _proportional allocation factors_:

$$
F^C_{ij} = \frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_n^N f(c_{nj})}
$$

\noindent and:

$$
F^P_i = \frac{P_i}{\sum_n^N P_m}
$$

The two factors are combined as follows:

$$
F_{ij}^T = \frac{F^C_{ij}F^P_i}{\sum_n^NF^C_{ij}F^P_i}
$$

\noindent to give the following expression for _spatial availability_:

$$
V_i = \sum_j^J O_jF^T_{ij}
$$

Compare again to accessibility:

$$
S_i = \sum_j^JO_jf(c_{ij})
$$

Spatial availability is a measure of the number of opportunities that are available from a location. It is singly constrained measure of accessibility.

- It constrains the sum of available opportunities to match the total number of opportunities in the region
- It is easier to interpret than accessibility
- It provides intuitive results
- It gives a natural baseline for equity analysis

## Exercise

This exercise is meant to be solved by hand. This is a great way to develop a good feeling for the mechanics of the method. See the figure below. It represents a tiny system with only two population centers ($a$ and $b$) and two employment centers ($A$ and $B$). 

![](images/Exercise.png)

For the exercise use the following impedance function for $c_{ij}$, where $c$ is trip duration in minutes:

$$
f(c_{ij}) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{c_{ij}^\beta} &\text{for } c_{ij}\le\delta\\
0 & \text{for } c_{ij}>\delta\\
\end{cases}
$$

Assume that the number of people and jobs at each location is as shown below:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
P_{a} = 80 \\
P_{b} = 120 \\
O_{A} = 100 \\
O_{B} = 50 
\end{array}
$$

Further, the travel times in minutes between these locations are:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
c_{aA} = 15 \\
c_{Ab} = 20 \\
c_{bB} = 15 
\end{array}
$$

Use $\beta=1$ and $\delta=45$ min.

As a reminder, accessibility is:

$$
S_i = \sum_j O_jf(c_{ij})
$$

                       # Remove columns that the function does not use

                     travel_cost = "travel_time", 
                     demand = "P", 
                     decay_function = decay_power(beta))
```

### Solution: Part 1

The spatial availability is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
V_{a} = 47.1 \text{ jobs}\\ 
V_{b} = 102.9 \text{ jobs}
\end{array}
$$

Next, suppose that there is an upgrade in the transportation system that shortens the duration of trips between $a-A$, so the new travel times are:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
c_{aA} = 5 \\
c_{Ab} = 20 \\
c_{bB} = 15 
\end{array}
$$

Continue to use $\beta =1$ and $\delta=45$ min.

```{r exercise-1-part-2, include=FALSE}
# Define the parameters for the scenario.
beta <- 1
delta<- 45

# Define the inputs for the scenario

# origin destination cost table. 
od <- data.frame(from_id = c("a", "a", "b", "b"), to_id = c("A", "B", "A", "B"), travel_time = c(5, 40, 20, 15))
# Land uses: population and opportunities.
lu <- data.frame(id = c("a", "b", "A", "B"), P = c(80, 120, 0, 0), O = c(0, 0, 100, 50))
```

```{r exercise-1-part-2-spatial-availability, include=FALSE}
Vij_2 <- spav()
Vi_2 <- Vij_2 |>
  group_by(from_id) |>
  summarize(Vi = sum(Vij))
```

```{r exercise-1-part-2-spatial-availability-package-accessibility, include=FALSE}
#Alternatively, using package {accessibilit}

spatial_availability(od |> 
                       # Remove columns that the function does not use
                       select(from_id, to_id, travel_time) |> 
                       # Remove od pairs that exceed the threshold
                       filter(travel_time <= 45), 
                     lu, 
                     opportunity = "O", 
                     travel_cost = "travel_time", 
                     demand = "P", 
                     decay_function = decay_power(beta))
```

### Questions: Part 2

1. Does the accessibility of $b$ change? Discuss.
1. Explain the changes to spatial availability $V_i$ and spatial availability per capita $v_i$ compared to those calculated using the earlier travel times.

### Solution: Part 2

The spatial availability is now as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
V_{a} = 82.7 \text{ jobs}\\ 
V_{b} = 67.3 \text{ jobs}
\end{array}
$$

## Practical example

For this practical example we will use data from the 2016 edition of the [Transportation Tomorrow Survey](http://dmg.utoronto.ca/tts-introduction/) (TTS). This is a comprehensive travel survey conducted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area every five years, and it includes rich information about travel patterns and the socio-demographic composition of the population in the region. For convenience, parts of the survey have been sourced in [{TTS2016R}](https://soukhova.github.io/TTS2016R/), an [open data product](https://rdcu.be/dn6yP). The data are augmented with other information, such as travel time tables, and distributed as analysis-ready data objects.

We will begin by loading the packages used in this example.
```
library(accessibility) # Transport Accessibility Measures # Transport Accessibility Measures
library(dplyr) # A Grammar of Data Manipulation # A Grammar of Data Manipulation
library(ggplot2) # Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics # Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
library(leaflet) # Create Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript 'Leaflet' Library # Create Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript 'Leaflet' Library
library(patchwork) # The Composer of Plots # The Composer of Plots
library(sf) # Simple Features for R # Simple Features for R
library(tidyr) # Tidy Messy Data # Tidy Messy Data
library(TTS2016R) # An augmented 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data package: worker and place of employment counts, trips and estimated travel time to work in the Greater Golden Horsehoe area, Canada # An augmented 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data package: worker and place of employment counts, trips and estimated travel time to work in the Greater Golden Horsehoe area, Canada
```

We will use two objects from the data package, information aggregated at the level of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) and an origin-destination table:
```{r}
data("ggh_taz") # Traffic analysis zones.
data("od") # Origin-destination table.
```

The data sets are documented, and you can check the help files like so:
```
?ggh_ttz
?od
```

For the exercise we will use a slice of the data, so we will extract the parts of the data corresponding to the City of Toronto. According to the TTS [Data Guide](http://dmg.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2016TTS_DataGuide.pdf) of TTS (p. 29), the identifiers of the TAZs in Toronto are 1-625. We will create a vector with those identifiers:
```{r}
TO_taz <- c(1:625) |> 
  as.character()
```

Using the vector we just created we will filter the zones corresponding to the City of Toronto, and then select the three variables that will be used in the example, namely the zone identifier (using the GTA06 zoning system), the number of workers in the zone (work age population), and the number of jobs in the zone:
```{r}
# Filter the traffic analysis zones in the City of Toronto.
lu <- ggh_taz |>
  filter(GTA06 %in% TO_taz) |>
  # Rename and select only the three variables needed for the example.
  transmute(id = GTA06,
            P = workers,
            O = jobs)
```

This selection somewhat simplifies a characteristic of the data set, because not all the workers living in Toronto work there, and not all jobs in Toronto are taken by people who live in Toronto. Given this caveat, we can calculate the jobs/workers ratio in the region:
```{r}
sum(lu$O)/sum(lu$P)
```

A summary of the table shows that workers in Toronto tend to be more dispersed than jobs. Some TAZs have zero workers (there is no housing in the zone) and some have zero jobs (they are purely residential): 
```{r}
lu |> 
  # Drop the geometry before reporting the summary.
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  summary()
```

The overall jobs/workers ratio is probably a little bit optimistic because Toronto tends to attract many commuting trips from beyond the city boundaries. Next, we will prepare the travel time matrix by filtering TAZ that are in Toronto.
```{r}
# Rename the table.
od_ggh <- od

# Filter the origin and destinations in the City of Toronto.
od <- od |>
  filter(Origin %in% lu$id, 
         Destination %in% lu$id) |>
  # Rename and select only the three variables needed for the example.
  transmute(from_id = Origin,
            to_id = Destination,
            travel_time)
```

Travel times in the table are in minutes. The longest travel time between any origin and any destination is:
```{r}
max(od$travel_time)
```

We will use an inverse power impedance function of the following form for the example:

$$
f(c_{ij}) = c_{ij}^{\beta}
$$

We present the example with $\beta = 0.005$ (try this value first; you can experiment with other values later if you wish). This is the shape of the curve with the initial value of $\beta$: 
```{r }
# Parameter for inverse power impedance function.
beta <- 0.005

# Plot impedance function with {ggplot}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 1/(abs(x)^beta),
                xlim = c(1, max(od$travel_time))) +
  xlab("t (travel time in min)") +
  ylab("f(t)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Package [{accessibility}](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/) includes functions to calculate both accessibility metrics and spatial avaialbility. The documentation can be consulted like so:
```
?accessibility
```

The inputs are a travel matrix (which in this example is our `od` table) and a land use table (which in our example is the `lu` table containing the opportunities and demand). 

We calculate the accessibility first. The function to do this is `accessibiliy::gravity()`. We need to specify the name of the columns with the opportunities, the cost, as well as the impedance function (here `accessibility::decay_power()`):
```{r applied-example-accessibility}
# Use table `od` with the travel time information for origin-destination pairs.
Si <- gravity(travel_matrix = od, 
              # Use 
              land_use_data = lu, 
              opportunity = "O", 
              travel_cost = "travel_time", 
              #demand = "workers", 
              decay_function = decay_power(beta)) |>
  rename(Si = O)
```

Next, we calculate the spatial availability. The inputs are very similar, with the addition of a variable for the demand (in our case the population). You will recall that the population is needed to calculate the proportional allocation factor. The spatial availability can be reported in a detailed table that gives $V_{ij}$, that is, the number of jobs available to each origin from each destination. The alternative (`detailed_results = FALSE`) returns the spatial availability aggregated by :
```{r applied-example-spatial-availability}
#Alternatively, using package {accessibilit}
Vij <- spatial_availability(travel_matrix = od |> 
                              select(from_id, to_id, travel_time), 
                            land_use_data = lu, 
                            opportunity = "O", 
                            travel_cost = "travel_time", 
                            demand = "P", 
                            decay_function = decay_power(beta),
                            detailed_results = TRUE) |>
  rename(Vij = O)
```


```{r applied-example-spatial-availability-by-zone}
Vi <- Vij |>
  group_by(from_id) |>
  summarize(Vi = sum(Vij)) |>
  rename(id = from_id)
```

Join the results to the zoning system for plotting:
```{r applied-example-join-results}
results <- lu |>
  left_join(Si,
            by = "id") |>
  left_join(Vi,
            by = "id")
```

Verify the total of jobs in the region, the jobs accessible, and the jobs available:
```{r applied-example-sanity-check}
# Sum of jobs in land use table,
sum(lu$O)
# Sum of jobs accessible.
sum(results$Si, na.rm = TRUE)
# Sum of jobs available.
sum(results$Vi, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Summary of results of accessibility and availability:
```{r applied-example-summary-results}
results |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  select(Si, Vi) |>
  summary()
```

Calculate values per capita:
```{r applied-example-values-per-capita}
results <- results |>
  mutate(si = Si/P,
         vi = Vi/P)
```

Summary of values per capita:
```{r applied-example-values-per-capita-summary}

  select(si, vi) |>

```

Render:

Ratio of $S_i$ to $V_i$ indicates that $S_i$ is not simply a scaled-up version of $V_i$ but rather something different:
```{r applied-example-ratio-accessibility-to-availability}

  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = 1, trans = "log10") +
  theme_void()
```

The same is true of $s_i$: the ratio of $s_i$ to $v_i$ indicates it is not simply a scaled-up version of $v_i$ but rather something different:
```{r applied-example-ratio-accessibility-to-availability-per-capita}
