  \begin{abstract}
  Accessibility measures are widely used in transportation, urban and
  healthcare planning, among other applications. These measures are
  weighted sums of the opportunities that can be reached given the cost
  of movement and are interpreted to represent the potential for spatial
  interaction. Though these measures are useful in understanding spatial
  structure, their methodologies double count opportunities which leads
  to interpretability issues, as noted in recent research on balanced
  floating catchment areas (BFCA) and competitive measures of
  accessibility. In this paper, we respond to the limitations of the
  accessibility measure by proposing a new measure of \emph{spatial
  availability} which is calculated by imposing a single constraint on
  the conventional gravity-based accessibility. Similar to the gravity
  model from which spatial availability is derived, a single constraint
  ensures that the marginals at the destination are met and thus the
  number of opportunities are preserved. Through examples, we detail the
  formulation of the proposed measure. Further, we use data from the
  2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of the Greater Golden Horseshoe
  area in southen Ontario, Canada to contrast how the conventional
  accessibility measure tends to overestimates and underestimates the
  number of jobs \emph{available} to workers. We conclude with some
  discussion of the possible uses of spatial availability. Overall, we
  argue that spatial availability can be a more meaningful and
  interpretable measure of opportunity access in relation to
  conventional accessibility. All data and code used in this research
  are openly available.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The concept of accessibility is a relatively simple one whose appeal
derives from combining the spatial distribution of opportunities and the
cost of reaching them (Hansen, 1959). Numerous methods for calculating
accessibility have been proposed that can be broadly organized into
infrastructure-, place-, person-, and utility-based measures (Geurs and
van Wee, 2004). Of these, the place-based family of measures is arguably
the most common, capturing the number of opportunities reachable from an
origin using the transportation network. A common type of placed-based
measure is the gravity measure of accessibility that captures the
potential for interaction; since it was first developed by Hansen (1959)
it has been widely adopted by literature in many forms (e.g., Cervero et
al., 2002; Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Handy and Niemeier, 1997; Levinson,
1998; Paez, 2004).

Accessibility analysis is employed in transportation, geography, public
health, and many other areas, particularly as mobility-based planning is
de-emphasized in favor of access-oriented planning (Deboosere et al.,
2018; Handy, 2020; Proffitt et al., 2017; Yan, 2021). However, while
measures of accessibility are excellent indicators of the intersection
between urban structure and transportation infrastructure, their
interpretability has been criticized in the past. Previous research has
highlighted how the weighting of opportunities using an impedance
function can make gravity measures more difficult for planners and
policymakers to interpret compared to simpler cumulative opportunity
measures (Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Miller, 2018). Moreover, because
place-based measures are sensitive to the number of opportunities and
the size of the opportunity-seeking population (e.g., a large city has
more nearby jobs and more job-seekers than a smaller city) raw values
cannot be easily compared across study areas (Allen and Farber, 2019).

For this reason, place-based intra- and inter-regional comparisons of
accessibility are challenging to interpret. Gravity-based accessibility
indicators are spatially smoothed estimates of the total number of
opportunities, however, the meaning of their magnitudes is unclear. This
is evident when we consider the ``total accessibility'' in the region, a
quantity that is not particularly meaningful since it is not constrained
to resemble, let alone match the number of opportunities available.
Furthermore, while accessibility depends on the number of opportunities
weighted by the travel costs associated with reaching them, the
calculated accessibilities are not sensitive to the demand for those
opportunities at the origins. Put another way, traditional measures of
place-based accessibility do not capture the competition for
opportunities. This shortcoming (Geurs and van Wee, 2004) is
particularly acute when opportunities are ``non-divisible'' in the sense
that, once taken they are no longer available to other members of the
population. Examples of indivisible opportunities include jobs (when a
person takes up a job, the same job cannot be taken by anyone else) and
placements at schools (once a student takes a seat at a school, that
particular opportunity is no longer available for another student). From
a different perspective, employers may see workers as opportunities, so
when a worker takes a job, this particular individual is no longer in
the available pool of candidates for hiring.

To remedy these issues, researchers have proposed several different
approaches for calculating competitive accessibility values. On the one
hand, this includes several approaches that first normalize the number
of opportunities available at a destination by the demand for them from
the origin zones and, second, sum the demand-corrected opportunities
which can be reached from the origins (e.g. Joseph and Bantock, 1984;
Shen, 1998). These advances were popularized in the family of two-step
floating catchment area methods (Luo and Wang, 2003) that have found
widespread adoption for calculating competitive accessibility to a
variety of opportunities such as healthcare, education, and food access
(B. Y. Chen et al., 2020; Chen, 2019; Z. Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
2006; Ye et al., 2018). In principle floating catchment areas purport to
account for competition/congestion effects, although in practice several
researchers (e.g., Delamater, 2013; Wan et al., 2012) have found that
they tend to over-estimate the level of demand and/or service. The
underlying issue, as demonstrated by Paez et al. (2019), is the multiple
counting of both population and level of service, which can lead to
biased estimates if not corrected.

A second approach is to impose constraints on the gravity model to
ensure flows between zones are equal to the observed totals. Based on
Wilson's (1971) entropy-derived gravity model, researchers can
incorporate constraints to ensure that the modeled flows match some
known quantities in the data inputs. In this way, models can be
singly-constrained to match the row- or column-marginals (the trips
produced or attracted, respectively), whereas a doubly-constrained model
is designed to match both marginals. Allen and Farber (2019) recently
incorporated a version of the doubly-constrained gravity model within
the floating catchment area approach to calculate competitive
accessibility to employment using transit across eight cities in Canada.
But while such a model can account for competition, the mutual
dependence of the balancing factors in a doubly-constrained model means
they must be iteratively calculated which makes them more
computationally-intensive. Furthermore, the double constraint means that
the sum of opportunity-seekers and the sum of opportunities must match,
which is not necessarily true in every potential use case (e.g., there
might be more people searching for work than jobs exist in a region).

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to measuring
competitive accessibility. We call it a measure of \textbf{spatial
availability} , and it aims to capture the number of indivisible
opportunities that are not only \emph{accessible} but also
\emph{available} to the opportunity-seeking population, in the sense
that they have not been claimed by a competing seeker of the
opportunity. As we will show, spatial availability is a
singly-constrained measure of accessibility. By allocating opportunities
in a proportional way based on demand and distance, this method avoids
the issues that result from multiple counting of opportunities in
conventional accessibility analysis. The method returns meaningful
accessibility estimates that correspond to the rate of available
opportunities per opportunity-seeking population. Moreover, the method
also returns a benchmark value for the region under study against which
results for individual origins can be compared both inter- and
intra-regionally.

In the following sections we will describe and illustrate this new
measure using a synthetic example and an empirical example. First, we
will describe the analytical framework of the measure. Second, we
calculate the spatial availability using data from the Transportation
Tomorrow Survey (TTS) home-to-work commute in 2016 for the Greater
Golden Horse (GGH) area in Ontario, Canada, and discuss differences with
conventional unconstrained accessibility analysis. Thirdly, we return to
the synthetic example and calculate spatial availability for two
additional use-cases: one use case for jobs from the perspective of the
population considering catchment restrictions and another use case for
workers from the perspective of employers. Finally, we conclude by
discussing the advantages of the spatial availability measure and the
breadth of potential uses.

In the spirit of openness of research in the spatial sciences (Brunsdon
and Comber, 2021; PÃ¡ez, 2021) this paper has a companion open data
product (Arribas-Bel et al., 2021), and all code will be available for
repeatability and reproducibility purposes.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

Most accessibility measures (excluding utility-based measures) are
derived from the gravity model and follow the formulation shown in
Equation (\ref{eq:conventional-accessibility}). The limitations
associated with this conventional and widely used measure, namely issues
in interpretation and spatial bias, are the motivation for the proposed
\emph{spatial availability} measure. We begin this section by
conceptually demonstrating the issues associated with the conventional
accessibility measure using a simple synthetic example and then we
introduce the analytical framework of spatial availability. In this way,
the differences between the measures and how spatial availability
improves the interpretability of opportunity access is more clear in
proceeding sections.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conventional-accessibility}
A_i = \sum_{j=1}^JO_jf(c_{ij})
\end{equation}

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A\) is accessibility.
\item
  \(i\) is a set of origin locations.
\item
  \(j\) is a set of destination locations.
\item
  \(O_j\) is the number of opportunities at location \(j\). These are
  opportunities for activity and add some sort of \emph{supply} to the
  area;
\item
  \(c_{ij}\) is a measure of the cost of moving between \(i\) and \(j\)
\item
  \(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function of \(c_{ij}\); it can take the
  form of any monotonically decreasing function chosen based on positive
  or normative criteria (Paez et al., 2012).
\end{itemize}

As formally defined, accessibility \(A_i\) is the weighted sum of
opportunities that can be reached from location \(i\), given the cost of
travel \(c_{ij}\). Summing the opportunities in the neighborhood of
\(i\), as determined by the impedance function \(f(\cdot)\), provides
estimates of the number of opportunities that can be reached from \(i\)
at a certain cost. The type of accessibility can be modified depending
on the impedance function; for example, the measure could be cumulative
opportunities (if \(f(\cdot)\) is a binary or indicator function e.g.,
El-Geneidy et al., 2016; Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Qi et al., 2018; Rosik
et al., 2021) or a gravity measure using an impedance function modeled
after any monotonically decreasing function (e.g., Gaussian, inverse
power, negative exponential, or log-normal, among others; see,
\emph{inter alia}, Kwan, 1998; Li et al., 2020; Reggiani et al., 2011;
Vale and Pereira, 2017).

\hypertarget{accessibility-numerical-example}{%
\subsection{Introducing the synthetic
example}\label{accessibility-numerical-example}}

The setup for our synthetic example is a system with three employment
centers and nine population centers, as summarized in Table
\ref{tab:toy-example}. Accessibility to jobs at each population center
is calculated using the accessibility measure \(A_i\) in Equation
(\ref{eq:conventional-accessibility}). In this simple example, we use
the straight line distance between the population and jobs for
\(c_{ij}\) and a negative exponential function with \(\beta = 0.0015\).
As noted, \(A_i\) represents the number of jobs (i.e., opportunities)
that can be reached from each population center given the estimated cost
as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility} shows the locations of the
three employment centers (black circles), where the size of the symbol
is in proportion to the number of jobs at each location. We also see
nine population centers (triangles), where the size of the symbol is
proportional to the accessibility (\(A_i\)) to jobs. The accessibility
values illustrates the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population centers (triangles) in the middle of the plot are
  relatively close to all three employment centers and thus have the
  highest levels of job accessibility. Population center P5 is
  relatively central and close to all employment centers, and it is the
  closest population to the second largest employment center in the
  region. Unsurprisingly, this population center has the highest
  accessibility 680.64);
\item
  Population centers (triangles) near the left edge of the map (only in
  proximity to the small employment center) have the lowest levels of
  job accessibility. Population center P1 is quite peripheral and the
  closest employment center is also the smallest one. Consequently, it
  has the lowest accessibility with \(A_i=\) 17.12);
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-effect-of-competition-for-opportunities}{%
\subsubsection{The effect of competition for
opportunities}\label{the-effect-of-competition-for-opportunities}}

Accessibility measures are excellent indicators of the intersection
between urban structure and transportation infrastructure (Kwan, 1998;
Reggiani et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2020). However, beyond enabling
comparisons of relative values they are not highly interpretable on
their own (Miller, 2018). For instance, from Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility}, P1 has lower accessibility than P5
but despite the accessibility value for P1 being relatively low it is
still better than \emph{zero}. To address this interpretability issue,
previous research has aimed to index and normalize values on a per
demand-population basis (e.g., Barboza et al., 2021; Pereira et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2021). However, as recent research on accessibility
discusses (see for instance Allen and Farber, 2019; Paez et al., 2019),
these steps do not address the bias introduced through the uneven
multiple-counting of opportunities which are unconstrained by
demand-side competition. This is similar to the congestion effect that
floating catchment area methods aim to address, although they do not
necessarily solve the issue completely (see Paez et al., 2019). The
underlying issue arises as a result of the underlying assumption that
for conventional accessibility \(A_i\) all opportunities for all origins
\(i=1,\cdots,n\) are \emph{available} to any one who can reach them: in
other words, they are assumed to be divisible and non-competitive. This
results in every opportunity entering the weighted sum once for every
origin \(i\) that can reach it. Put another way, if a densely populated
population center pops up next to P5 this center too will have a high
accessibility score since \(A_i\) does not consider competition of
opportunities from neighbouring population centers. Neglecting to
constraint opportunity counts (i.e., single-constraint) obscures the
interpretability of accessibility which may manifests in the following
two ways of biased estimation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Demand centers in the less dense outer limits of the urban core may be
  assigned disproportionately \emph{high} accessibility values. These
  periphery areas are traditionally located in proximity to more dense
  urban demand centers and large urban opportunity centers and thus may
  have low travel cost to these large opportunity centers. Accessibility
  \(A_i\) does not consider opportunity-constraints and, as such, these
  periphery demand centers benefit from the high accessibility to
  opportunities without competition considerations from their more dense
  and more centrally located neighbours.
\item
  Remote areas which are still within the region of the analysis and
  have regionally-relative low demand centers, opportunity centers, and
  travel cost to opportunity centers, are assigned disproportionately
  \emph{low} accessibility values. These more remote areas may be
  sufficiently supplied with opportunities proportionate to their demand
  but this relationship is obscured by the artificially high
  accessibility awarded to demand- and opportunity- rich areas in which
  competition disproportionately occurs.
\end{enumerate}

The spatially uneven multiple-counting of opportunities (i.e., the
competition effect) leave decision makers unclear on how to interpret
resulting accessibility estimates. All recent accessibility measures
which seek to improve interpretability are either vulnerable to this
impact or require potentially unrealistic assumptions. As previously
mentioned, the floating catchment areas (FCA) method increases
interpretability by purporting to account for competition, however, as
discussed by Paez, Higgins, and Vmpeivona (2019), FCA methods are
vulnerable to a similar multiple-counting effect. On this same note, the
doubly-constrained gravity model proposed by Allen and Farber (2019)
which is based on the FCA method, accounts for competition, but requires
that the magnitude of demand matches the opportunities or be re-scaled
to match. As already noted, this assumption is not always realistic for
many opportunity types such as in the case of job seekers and jobs.

To address the competition effect and introduce a more realistic
assumption regarding non-divisible opportunities, we propose a
singly-constrained gravity measure called \textbf{spatial availability}.
This measure seeks to answer the following questions for an individual
at a specific demand center: \emph{``many opportunities are accessible,
but the same opportunities are also accessible to my (possibly) numerous
neighbours\ldots{} what does a high accessibility actually mean to
me?''} and \emph{``a few opportunities are accessible to me but I am
located in a remote area with proportionally few neighbours relative to
the region\ldots{} what does low accessibility mean to me?''}. Beyond
the individual, spatial availability, can also be used as-is to evaluate
the \emph{spatial mismatch} of accessible opportunities and
demand-seeking population within regions and between regions.

\hypertarget{the-analytical-framework-of-spatial-availability-spatial-availability-framework}{%
\subsection{The analytical framework of spatial availability
\{spatial-availability-framework\}}\label{the-analytical-framework-of-spatial-availability-spatial-availability-framework}}

Formally, spatial availability \(V_{ij}\) is defined by opportunities
\(O\) which are proportionally allocated based on a population
allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) and cost of travel allocation factor
\(F^c_{ij}\) for all origins \(i\) to all destinations \(j\) as detailed
in Equation (\ref{eq:spatial-availability}). In line with the tradition
of gravity modeling, the proposed framework distinguishes between
opportunities at a destination and demand for opportunities at the
origin.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spatial-availability}
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^K F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(V_{ij}\) is spatial availability.
\item
  \(i\) is a set of origin locations in the region \(K\).
\item
  \(j\) is a set of destination locations in the region \(K\).
\item
  \(O_j\) is the number of opportunities at location \(j\) in the region
  \(K\).
\item
  \(F^p_{ij}\) is the proportional allocation factor of the population
  in \(i\) relative to the population in region \(K\).
\item
  \(F^c_{ij}\) is the proportion allocation factor of travel cost for
  \(i\) relative to the travel cost in region \(K\); it is a product of
  a monotonically decreasing (i.e., impedance) function associated with
  the cost of travel between \(i\) and \(j\).
\end{itemize}

To illustrate the analytical framework,

Since spatial availability \(V_{ij}\) consists of these two allocation
factors, we detail first how the role of population allocation factor
\(F^p_{ij}\) in producing \(V^p_{ij}\), next the role of the travel cost
allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) in producing \(V^c_{ij}\), and finally
how both allocation factors in the final general form of spatial
availability \(V_{ij}\) are combined. The calculation of spatial
availability is introduced with a step-by-step example for two
population centers (\(P_2\) and \(P_3\)) in the role of demand (i.e.,
the number of individuals in the labour market who `demand' employment)
and one employment center (\(O_1\)) in the role of opportunities.

\hypertarget{population-and-travel-cost-allocation-factors}{%
\subsubsection{Population and travel cost allocation
factors}\label{population-and-travel-cost-allocation-factors}}

We begin with allocation based on demand; consider an employment center
\(j\) with \(O_j^r\) jobs of type \(r\). In the general case where there
are \(K\) population centers in the region, the following factor can be
defined in Equation (\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor}
F^p_{ij} = \frac{P_{i\in r}^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^K P_{i\in r}^\alpha}
\end{equation}

The population allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) corresponds to the
proportion of the population in origin \(i\) relative to the rest of the
region's population centres \(K\). On the right hand side of the
equation, the numerator \(P_{i\in r}\) is the population at origin \(i\)
that is eligible and `demand' jobs of type \(r\) (e.g., those with a
certain level of training or in a designated age group, etc.). The
summation in the denominator is over \(i=1,\cdots,K\), the number of
population at all origins \(i\) in the region \(K\). To modulate the
effect of the size in from this factor we also add an empirical
parameter \(\alpha\) (i.e., \(\alpha <1\) places greater weight on
smaller centres relative to larger ones while \(\alpha>1\) achieves the
opposite effect). This population allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) can now
be used to proportionally allocate a share of the jobs at a destination
\(j\) to all origin pairs.

More broadly, since the factor \(F^p_{ij}\) is a proportion, when it is
summed over \(i=1,\cdots,K\) it always equals to 1 (i.e.,
\(\sum_i^{K} F^p_{ij} = 1\)). This is notable since the share of jobs
(the spatial availability based on population \(V^p_{ij}\)) at each
destination \(j\) allocated to (i.e., available to) each origin is equal
to \(V^p_{ij} = O_j \cdot F^p_{ij}\) and since the sum of F\^{}p\_\{ij\}
is equal to 1 it follows that \(\sum_{i=1}^I V_{ij} = O_j\). In other
words, the number of jobs across the region is preserved. The result is
a proportional allocation of jobs (opportunities) to origins based on
population demand; this factor does not consider travel cost, that is
defined in the travel cost allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) which is
introduced shortly.

To illustrate the population allocation factor, consider an employment
center has 300 jobs (\(O_1= 300\)) in a region with two population
centers which have 240 and 120 people, respectively, (\(P_2= 240\) and
\(P_3 = 120\)). For simplicity, assume that all the population in the
region is eligible for these jobs, that is, that the entirety of the
population is included in the set \(r\). Also assume that \(\alpha=1\)
meaning the only impact on value is the population size for each center.
The population allocation factors \(F^p_{ij}\) for the jobs at \(O_1\)
for each population center \(P_2\) and \(P_3\) would be defined as shown
in Equation (\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
F^p_{2,1} = \frac{P_2 ^\alpha}{P_2^\alpha + P_3^\alpha} = \frac{240}{240 + 120} = \frac{240}{360}\\
F^p_{3,1} = \frac{P_3^\alpha}{P_2^\alpha + P_3^\alpha}  = \frac{120}{240 + 120} = \frac{120}{360}\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The \(F^p_{ij}\) values can be used to find a \emph{partial} spatial
availability of jobs which is only defined by the relative population
demanding jobs; this partial spatial availability \(V^p_{ij}\) for each
population center is calculated as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor-SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor-SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V^p_{2,1} = O_1 \cdot F^p_{2,1} = 300 \cdot \frac{240}{360} = 200 \\
V^p_{3,1} = O_1 \cdot F^p_{3,1} = 300 \cdot \frac{120}{360} = 100 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

When using only the proportional allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) to
calculate spatial availability (differentiated here by being defined as
\(V^p_{ij}\) instead of \(V_{ij}\)), proportionally more jobs are
allocated to the bigger population center (i.e., 2 times more jobs as it
is 2 times larger in population). We can also see that the sum of
spatial availability for all population centers is equal to the sum of
jobs, i.e., total opportunities are preserved. However, as mentioned,
using only the proportional allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) to calculate
spatial availability does not account for how far population centers
\(P_2\) or \(P_3\) are from employment center \(O_1\). To account for
this effect, we introduce a second allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) based
on distance to the employment centers defined in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-alloc-factor}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-alloc-factor}
F^c_{ij} = \frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_{i=1}^K f(c_{ij})}\\
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(c_{ij}\) is the cost (e.g., the distance, travel time,
etc.) from population center \(i\) to employment center \(j\), and
\(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function that is a monotonically decreasing
function of cost (\(c_{ij}\)); in other words, the travel cost
allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) serves to proportionally allocates more
jobs to closer locations through an impedance function. To continue
illustrating, assume that the impedance function is a negative
exponential function and assume that \(\beta\). This parameter modulates
the steepness of the impedance effect and is empirically determined in
the case of positive accessibility, or set by the analyst to meet a
preset condition in the case of normative accessibility (Paez et al.,
2012). For the sake of the example, we set a value of 1. Also suppose
that the distance from population center \(P_2\) to employment center
\(O_1\) is 0.6 km, and the distance from population center \(P_3\) to
employment center \(O_1\) is 0.3 km. The proportional allocation factor
\(F^p_{ij}\) for the jobs at \(O_1\) for both population centers \(P_2\)
and \(P_3\) is defined as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
F^c_{2,1} = \frac{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1})}{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1}) + \exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})} = \frac{\exp(-0.6)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 0.426\\
F^c_{3,1} = \frac{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})}{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1}) + \exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})}  = \frac{\exp(-0.3)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 0.574\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

We can see that the proportional allocation factor for \(P_3\) is larger
than \(P_2\) since the cost (i.e., distance) to \(O_1\) is shorter.
Using the travel cost proportional allocation factors \(F^c_{ij}\) as
defined in Equation (\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}), we
can now calculate the spatial availability of jobs for each population
center based only on \(F^c_{ij}\) and the jobs available \(O_1\) to
these two competing population centers (note: \(V^c_{ij}\) not the
complete \(V_{ij}\)) as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V^c_{2,1} = O_1 \cdot F^c_{2,1} = 300 \times 0.426 = 127.8\\
V^c_{3,1} = O_1 \cdot F^c_{3,1} = 300 \times  0.574 = 172.2\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

As shown, the spatial availability defined by \(F^c_{ij}\) (i.e.,
\(V^c_{ij}\)) allocates \(P_3\) a larger share of jobs since the
population center is closer to \(O_1\). However, as previously
discussed, \(P_3\) has a smaller population than \(P_2\), so \(P_2\)
receives a larger share of jobs when spatial availability when it is
defined by \(F^p_{ij}\) (i.e., \(V^p_{ij}\)). It is necessary to combine
both population and travel cost factors to better reflect demand; these
two components are in line with how demand is conventionally modelled in
accessibility calculations which are re-scale on a per demand-population
basis or also consider competition (e.g., Allen and Farber, 2019;
Barboza et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2006). Fortunately, since both
\(F^c_{ij}\) and \(F^p_{ij}\) preserve the total number of opportunities
(jobs) as they independently sum to 1, they can be combined
multiplicatively to calculate the proposed spatial availability
(\(V_{ij}\)) which considers demand to be based on both population and
travel cost.

\hypertarget{putting-spatial-availability-together}{%
\subsubsection{Putting spatial availability
together}\label{putting-spatial-availability-together}}

We can combine the proportional allocation factors by population
\(F^p_{ij}\) and travel cost \(F^c_{ij}\) and calculate spatial
availability \(V_{ij}\) as introduced in Equation
(\ref{eq:spatial-availability}) and repeated below:

\[
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^K F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}
\]

To complete the illustrative example of employment center \(O_1\) and
population centers \(P_2\) and \(P_3\), the resulting spatial
availability \(V_{ij}\) is calculated for both population centers is
calculated in Equation (\ref{eq:SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V_{2,1} = O_1\cdot \frac{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1}}{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1} + F^p_{3,1} \cdot F^c_{3,1}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)} = 179.4\\
V_{3,1} = O_1\cdot \frac{F^p_{3,1} \cdot F^c_{3,1}}{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1} + F^p_{ik} \cdot F^c_{ik}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}  =  120.6 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

As can be seen, fewer jobs are allocated to population center \(P_2\)
compared to the allocation by population only, to account for the higher
cost of reaching the employment center. On the other hand, distance
alone allocated more jobs to the closest population center (i.e.,
\(P_3\)), but since it is smaller, it also gets a smaller share of the
jobs overall. To reiterate, the sum of jobs at employment center \(O_1\)
that are allocated to population centers \(P_2\) and \(P_3\)
simultaneously based on \emph{population-} and \emph{travel cost}
allocation factors are preserved (i.e., \(V_{2,1} + V_{3,1} = O_1\)).

In the common case that population centers have multiple destination
opportunities \(j\), spatial availability is simply the sum of Equation
(\ref{eq:spatial-availability}) for all opportunities \(J\) (i.e.,
\(V_i = \sum_{j=1}^J V_{ij}\)). The resulting value of \(V_i\)
represents opportunities (e.g., jobs) that can be accessed from origin
\(i\) and that are \emph{not} allocated to any other competing origin:
\(V_i\) is thus the weighted sum of available opportunities and is the
\emph{opportunity access} for that origin \(i\) considering constrained
opportunity availability. When comparing \(V_i\) to the
singly-constrained gravity model (see Wilson (1971)), \(V_i\) is the
result of constraining \(A_i\) to match one of the marginals in the
origin-destination table, the known total of opportunities.

Since the sum of opportunities is preserved in the procedures above, it
is possible to calculate a highly interpretable measure of spatial
availability per capita (lower-case \(v_i\)) as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:SA-per-capita}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-per-capita}
v_i = \frac{V_i}{P_i}
\end{equation}

To complete the illustrative example, the per capita spatial
availability of jobs would be calculated as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:SA-per-capita-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-per-capita-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
v_{2,1} = \frac{V_{2,1}}{P_2} =  \frac{179.4}{240} = 0.8\\
v_{3,1} =  \frac{V_{3,1}}{P_3} =  \frac{120.6}{120} = 1.0\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

We can see that since \(P_3\) is closer to \(O_1\) and has less
competition (as it has a smaller population than \(P_2\)), \(P_3\)
benefits with a higher spatial availability of jobs per job-seeking
population. We can also compare these values to the overall ratio of
jobs-to-population in this region of one job center and two population
centers is \(300/(240 + 120)=\) 0.83.

\section{Empirical data set: measuring spatial availability and
accessibility of jobs in the
GGH}\label{empirical-data-set-measuring-spatial-availability-and-accessibility-of-jobs-in-the-ggh}}

Two examples using an empirical data set of home-based work trips is
used in this section. The first example demonstrates how accessibility
broadly overestimates \emph{job access} (relative to spatial
availability) and particularly overestimates job access for areas in the
less dense outer limits of the urban core. The second example
demonstrates how accessibility underestimates job access for areas in
the urban periphery. We first introduce the data used, then calibrate
the impedance function, and finally visualize the two examples.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The home-based work trips from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey
(TTS) area is retained; the TTS collects representative urban travel
information from 20 municipalities contained within the GGH area in
southern part of Ontario, Canada (see Figure
\ref{fig:TTS-16-survey-area}) (Data Management Group, 2018). These
home-based work trips include origins and employment destinations
defined by centroids of Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ) (n=3,764), the
number of jobs (n=3,081,900) and workers (n=3,446,957) at each origin
and destination, and the number trips from origin to destination for the
morning home-to-work commute (n=3,446,957).

To generate the travel cost for these trips, the travel time by from
origin to destination is calculated using the R package \texttt{r5r}
(Rafael H. M. Pereira et al., 2021) and the following input parameter
assumptions: a 7:00 am departure on Wednesday October 20th 2021, a
maximum travel time less than or equal to 180 mins (3 hrs), and a street
network retrieved from OpenStreetMaps for the GGH area. The 7:00 am
departure corresponds to a typical AM home-to-work departure and the 3
hr threshold was selected as it captures 99\% of the trip taken (see the
travel times summarized in Table \ref{tab:TTS-16-desc-stats}).

It is important to note that all travel times within this data set are
calculated assuming car travel and one departure time for all orgins.
These are unrealistic assumptions since we know a minority of trips are
taken by non-car modes and travel time departure varies, however, we do
not know which trips are made with non-car modes nor exact departures.
Though modal split and travel times can be estimated through other
methods (e.g., Allen and Farber, 2021; Higgins et al., 2021), for
simplicity, we carry on with the assumption that all trips are taken by
one-time departure car trip.

\subsection{Calibrating an impedance
function}\label{calibrating-an-impedance-function}}

In the synthetic example introduced in a
\protect\hypertarget{accessibility-numerical-example}{}{preceding
section}, an arbitrary negative exponential function describing travel
cost (as a function of distance) was used as the impedance function. In
this TTS work commute example, an impedance function is calibrated based
on the trip length distribution (TLD). For background, a TLD is the
representation of the likelihood that a proportion of trips are taken at
a specific travel cost (e.g., travel time); this distribution is
commonly used to derive impedance functions in accessibility research
(Batista et al., 2019; Horbachov and Svichynskyi, 2018).

The empirical and theoretical TLD for this data set are represented in
the top-left panel of Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}. Maximum
likelihood estimation and the Nelder-Mead method for direct optimization
available within the \texttt{fitdistrplus} package (Delignette-Muller
and Dutang, 2015) were used. Based on goodness-of-fit criteria and
diagnostics seen in Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}, the gamma
distribution was selected (also see Figure \ref{fig:plot-cullen-frey} in
the Appendix).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/impedance_function} \caption{\label{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}Empirical TTS 2016 home-based car trip length distribution (black) and calibrated gamma distribution impedance function (red) with associated Q-Q and P-P plots}\label{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}
\end{figure}

The gamma distribution, which serves as the impedance function for the
TTS data set, is given in the following general form where the estimated
`shape' is \(\alpha=\) 2.019, the estimated `rate' is \(\beta =\) 0.094,
and \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is defined in Equation (\ref{gamma-dist}).

\begin{equation}
\label{gamma-dist}
\begin{array}{l}\ 
f(x, \alpha, \beta) = \frac {x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}}{ \beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq \infty\\

\Gamma(\alpha) =  \int_{0}^{\infty} x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x} \,dx\\

\end{equation}

\hypertarget{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-toronto}{%
\subsection{Measuring access to jobs in
Toronto}\label{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-toronto}}

Toronto is the largest city in the GGH and represents a significant
subset of workers and jobs in the GGH; 50\% of workers in the GGH travel
to jobs in Toronto and 72\% of jobs are located within Toronto. As will
be later discussed, when accessibility and spatial availability values
are compared, this significant subset of jobs illustrates the first
issue associated with the competition effect. Specifically, since
accessibility does not include the single-opportunity constraint like
spatial availability does, accessibility \emph{overestimates} job access
for many TAZ.

Accessibility is first calculated and presented in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}. It is conventionally interpreted
that the higher the accessibility value, the more \emph{accessible}
potential employment opportunities are to home-based origins . The
accessibility values in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}
follow a radial trend where the majority of TAZ in the core of Toronto
have high accessibility values and increasingly lower values In TAZ
which are further from the city boundary. This general trend is echoed
in qualitative studies which find the further from Toronto the longer
the employment commute (Axisa et al., 2012) and the closer to core of
Toronto the more opportunities are accessible {[}for some to certain
types of jobs; PÃ¡ez et al. (2013){]}.

Next, competitive job access is calculated using the spatial
availability measure and is presented alongside the accessibility plot
in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}. Similar to the
accessibility plot, the higher the value the more access that TAZ has to
jobs in the city of Toronto. Since spatial availability constrains the
total number of opportunities, high values of spatial availability can
be seen as higher access to \emph{available} jobs (i.e., competitive job
access) and we can observe which TAZ have spatial availability values
which are above or below the regional average of 638.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}Calculated accessibility (top) and spatial availability (bottom) of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the City of Toronto.}\label{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}
\end{figure}

\newpage

The visual differences between accessibility and spatial availability
plots in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS} are stark. The TAZ
within and 10-20 km outside of Toronto's boundary have relatively lower
values (i.e., fewer reds and oranges) as measured by spatial
availability than as measured by accessibility. There are also more
pockets of low job availability (i.e., blues) within the city of Toronto
once competition to those jobs is accounted for.

To enhance the interpretability of spatial availability, the measure can
be normalized to provide more meaningful insight into how many jobs are
\emph{available} on average for each TAZ. This normalization, shown in
Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker}, demonstrates which
TAZ have above (reds) and below (blue) the average (0.38) available jobs
per worker in the GGH to jobs located within the city of Toronto.
Similarly, we can also observe an uneven spatial distribution of job
access within Toronto (as also shown in the spatial availability plot in
Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS}) where spatially available
jobs are consistently distant from the average and often greater than 1
job per worker for the south-central and south-west TAZ in Toronto,
although this trend is not as pronounced in the south-east and other
pockets in the City.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker}Calculated spatial availability of employment, per worker, from origins in the GGH to destinations in the City of Toronto.}\label{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker}

\newpage

\hypertarget{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-the-ggh}{%
\subsection{Measuring access to jobs in the
GGH}\label{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-the-ggh}}

Next, we repeat the analysis for all origins to \emph{all} jobs in the
GGH using both accessibility and spatial availability measures. As will
be later discussed, the full TTS data set demonstrates the second issue
associated with the competition effect: the \emph{underestimation} of
job access. This underestimation occurs in TAZ that are located in the
periphery of the GGH which are relatively isolated (by travel cost) from
the relatively highest concentration of opportunities located in
Toronto. Within the full TTS data set we also observe the first issue of
\emph{overestimation} in TAZ that are on the outer limits outside the
Toronto border but for reasons that differ from the analysis of jobs
only in Toronto.

Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS} presents the accessibility and
spatial availability for the full TTS data set. Interestingly, general
trends between Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS} and Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS} are similar for the accessibility plots
but not for the spatial availability plots. Within the two accessibility
plots, job access values follow a radial trend where the majority of TAZ
in Toronto have high accessibility values and values decrease in TAZ
which are further from the city boundary. This radial effect is less
pronounced in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-Toronto-TTS} than in the
following Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS} since opportunities
are only present in Toronto for the former and all opportunities are
present in the later. Conversely, the two spatial availability plots do
not appear to follow this radial trend; job access, as measured by
spatial availability, appears much more even throughout the GGH (in
comparison to job access as measured by accessibility). This can be
noted in higher values around the north east and south west periphery
TAZ and more moderate values in and around Toronto.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}Calculated accessibility (top) and spatial availability (bottom) of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the GGH}\label{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Similar to the per worker spatial availability plot for jobs in Toronto,
the following Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-GGH-TTS-per-worker} depicts
which TAZ have above or below average job access after being normalized
by the number of workers in each TAZ (i.e., 0.89 jobs per worker)
considering all jobs and workers in the GGH. Similar to the spatial
availability plot of the GGH jobs in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}, we can see that many average or above
average jobs per worker TAZ (whites) and reds) are present in southern
Peel and Halton (south-west of Toronto), Waterloo and Brantford (even
more south-west of Toronto), and Hamilton and Niagara (south of
Toronto), however, the distribution is uneven and many TAZ within these
areas do have below average values (blues).

Interestingly, when considering the jobs which are \emph{available},
many areas outside of Toronto have similar jobs per worker values as TAZ
in Toronto. This is contrary to the common belief that Toronto is one of
the only hubs for employment opportunities . For instance, urban centers
outside of Toronto such as those found in Brantford, Guelph, southern
Peel, Halton, and Niagara have TAZ which are far above the the TTS
average jobs per worker and higher than TAZ within Toronto. This finding
is not seen in the accessibility plot (Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}) which suggests that these less densely
populated areas may have sufficient employment opportunities for their
populations; This finding is obscured when only considering the
accessibility measure for job access as will be later discussed.

It is also worth noting that there is almost two times more jobs per
worker in the GGH jobs spatial availability results than the GGH toronto
spatial availability results. This suggests that all GGH people who work
in the city of Toronto, on average, face more competition for jobs than
all GGH people who work anywhere in the GGH .

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In the preceding section we used both accessibility and spatial
availability to explore the job access landscape in the GGH. To build on
thea findings, we return to the two issues associated with the
accessibility \(A_i\) measure. As we described, accessibility has the
tendency to overestimate job access for areas which may experience high
competition (issue 1) and underestimate job access for areas with low
competition (issue 2).

To compare both accessibility and spatial availability, we calculate
their relative magnitudes by re-scaling both measures from 0 to 100
where each value of the measure is divided by the maximum value as
described in Equation \ref{eq:index-measures} by \(A^I_{ij}\) and
\(V^I_{ij}\). Re-scaling is repeated for both measures for the subset of
jobs in Toronto and for all jobs in the GGH and differences are
calculated as described in Equation \ref{eq:dif-index-measures}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:index-measures}
\begin{array}{l}\
A^I_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\max(A_{ij})}\cdot100\\
V^I_{ij} = \frac{V_{ij}}{\max(V_{ij})}\cdot100\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dif-index-measures}
Dif_{ij} = \frac{V^I_{ij} - A^I_{ij}}{A^I_{ij}}\cdot100
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{overestimating-jobs-access-first-issue-with-accessibility}{%
\subsection{Overestimating jobs access: first issue with
accessibility}\label{overestimating-jobs-access-first-issue-with-accessibility}}

For the subset of jobs in Toronto and all origins in the GGH, 98.9\% of
TAZ have re-scaled spatial availability values which are lower than
re-scaled accessibility values. Of this 98.9\%, the spatial availability
value is on average -80.64\% different than the accessibility value and
the difference ranges between -2.95\% to -99.9\%. Furthermore, to
emphasis the similarity of this difference measure between neighbouring
TAZ, the spatial autocorrelation is calculated using Moran's I statistic
(Anselin, 1995) and TAZ with a significant p-value (\(p\le 0.10\)) are
more vividly presented. Figure \ref{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto} displays
the described plotted comparison, where the more negative the value, the
more the accessibility measure overestimation job access relative to
spatial availability for each TAZ. It should be noted that although the
majority of TAZ job access values are overestimated by accessibility,
the 23 TAZ which are underestimated are shown in grey.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-local-i-Toronto-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto}Difference between re-scaled the accessibility and the spatial availability job access measure in the context of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the City of Toronto.

TAZs with values which are higher than re-scaled accessibility (positive difference) are shown fully in grey.}\label{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto}
\end{figure}

We can see from Figure \ref{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto} that when we
re-scale both job access values, accessibility consistently
\emph{overestimates} job access compared to the spatial availability
measure for jobs within the city of Toronto. Overestimation ranges from
-100\% to -3\% and is on average -81\%. However, while job access is
consistently overestimated, it is overestimated in a variable way. The
TAZ with the largest difference in measure are depicted in red and
orange (quantiles 1 and 2) and can be seen, in sometimes concentrated
clusters (as indicated by the 2044 TAZ with a significant Moran I's
statistic) approximately 10-20 kms outside of Toronto's border and along
the south side of the GGH. These TAZ also have a relatively low density
of people who work in Toronto so the difference between measures has a
significant correlation (0.877) with the number of workers in each TAZ.

Nonetheless, the density of workers within each TAZ alone does not fully
explain the variation in overestimation as the travel cost and the
number of opportunities factor into the calculation for both measures.
From the perspective of accessibility, since opportunity-constraints are
not considered, the \emph{overestimated} TAZ (relative to spatial
availability) are awarded higher values because they are more centrally
located to opportunities (i.e., low travel cost) and are not discounted
from being in proximity to highly competitive TAZ (i.e., high density of
workers). On the other hand, spatial availability considers this
competition by proportionally allocating jobs to TAZ relative to their
travel cost and worker population. In other words, TAZ appears
\emph{overestimated} when the impact of travel cost alone outpaces the
impact of both travel cost and workers thus the proportional allocation
of opportunity results in a significantly smaller job access than the
resulting value for accessibility. This is why TAZ which are
exceptionally overestimated (reds and oranges) are on the periphery of
more densely populated urban cities. These TAZ are located far enough
away from workers in densely populated TAZ but still relatively close
enough to jobs in Toronto. As such, their high accessibility value is a
result of counting many more opportunities than the single-constrained
spatial availability proportionally allocates.

\hypertarget{underestimating-jobs-access-second-issue-with-accessibility}{%
\subsection{Underestimating jobs access: second issue with
accessibility}\label{underestimating-jobs-access-second-issue-with-accessibility}}

Next, we demonstrate the difference between the two job access values
for the full data set, namely, all jobs within the GGH and all workers
within the GGH. While the majority of TAZ have difference values which
correspond to accessibility being overestimated relative to spatial
availability, 17\%\% of TAZ are underestimated. These underestimated TAZ
are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH} alongside the
overestimated TAZ for comparison. Of the underestimated TAZ, the spatial
availability value is on average 214.7\% different than the
accessibility value and the difference ranges between 0\% to -99.9\%.
The overestimated TAZ have a spatial availability value that is on
average 214.7\% different than the accessibility value and the
difference ranges between 0\% to -99.9\%. Moran's I is not plotted but
the statistics is significant (i.e., there is spatial autocorrelation)
for the full data set (\(p< 0.001\) for all difference values).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-difference-GGH-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-difference-GGH}Difference between re-scaled the accessibility and the spatial availability job access measure in the context of employment from all origins and destinations in the GGH. Values are expressed in five quantile ranges. Vivid TAZs represent a significant spatial autocorrelation and dimmed TAZs represent a non-signficant autocorrelation as measured by Local Moran's I only for underestimated TAZs. TAZs with values which are higher than re-scaled accessibility (positive difference) are shown fully in grey.}\label{fig:plot-difference-GGH}
\end{figure}

As observed from Figure \ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}, TAZ with
underestimated job access (i.e., re-scaled accessibility values are
smaller than re-scaled spatial availability values) are located on the
periphery of the GGH area. The majority of these underestimated TAZ are
not within the center of the GGH where Toronto and the Greater Toronto
Area (GTA) is located but are in proximity to other, smaller, employment
areas within smaller municipalities. It can be understood that the
underestimation of TAZ is a result of both high spatial availability as
a result of low job competition and low accessibility scores that are a
by-product of the job multiple-counting occurring within more densely
job-populated TAZ in the GTA. Accessibility's multiple-counting
effectively deflates the job access in these peripheral TAZ since their
accessibility values are significantly lower compared to their
multiple-counted GTA TAZ neighbours. The impact of this
multiple-counting is starkly apparent when compared to the re-scaled
spatial availability measure since spatial availability allocates jobs
proportionally based on workers and travel cost, TAZ do not
multiple-counting of jobs and TAZ which are not in the position to
multiple-count are not deflated as a consequence. This is supported by
viewing the spatial availability of jobs per worker (Figure
\ref{fig:plot-avail-GGH-TTS-per-worker}) where we can see that
commercial areas throughout the GGH area have similar job access values
as within some commercial areas in the GTA; this is not the case for the
accessibility measure (see trends in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}).

Next, it is worth explaining why accessibility's multiple-counting does
not also result in the underestimation of job access when only
considering the jobs available in Toronto. As depicted in the previous
Figure \ref{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto}, almost all TAZ are overestimated
(i.e., accessibility values are \emph{higher} than spatial
availability). Within this subset of jobs in these peripheral TAZ,
spatial availability is proportionally allocated based on their high
travel cost (compared to the region) and Toronto-working population. In
essence, these TAZ experience moderately high job competition and thus
have low spatial availability. When accessibility is calculated, these
peripheral TAZ have low accessibility as a result of the
multiple-counting which occurs within and around Toronto but when the
two measures are compared, however, accessibility is still \emph{higher}
than spatial availability. The difference in the two measures flips when
the workers who work in areas outside of Toronto are re-introduced to
these peripheral TAZ as represented in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}. Since more workers (more competition) and
more jobs with lower travel costs (less competition) are introduced, it
can be inferred that these peripheral TAZ experience moderately higher
job access (compared to spatial availability per worker within these
periphery TAZ in Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker} and
Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-GGH-TTS-per-worker}). Conversely, for the
accessibility measure, the introduction of additional workers does not
meter the accessibility gained by the introduction of additional jobs
and as such, the re-scaled accessibility values are \emph{higher} than
the spatial availability resulting in underestimated TAZ.

It is also worth noting that the right panel of Figure
\ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}, by contrast, depicts all the TAZ with
overestimated job access (i.e., re-scaled accessibility values are
larger than re-scaled spatial availability values). Similar to the
difference between measures depicted in the previous Figure
\ref{fig:plot-local-i-Toronto} for the subset of jobs located in
Toronto, these TAZ which are mostly within the GTA reflect an increased
accessibility as a result of multiple-counting of jobs and a
comparatively low spatial availability as a result of high job
competition. Overall, within the full set of jobs in the GGH, the first
and second issue associated with accessibility's competition effect are
observed.

\hypertarget{contextualizing-additional-spatial-availability-use-cases}{%
\section{Contextualizing additional spatial availability use
cases}\label{contextualizing-additional-spatial-availability-use-cases}}

In addition to measuring access to jobs for workers, spatial
availability can be used to measure many other opportunity types and
scenarios. In this section we demonstrate two additional ways in which
spatial availability can be applied. Since spatial availability
singly-constraints opportunities which are allocated to the demand
seeking population, opportunities or demand seeking populations can be
subset while the resulting access measure does not lose any
interpretability. As such, we firstly present a practical application is
calculating job access for a specialized subset of population to
specialized employment centers. We then present an application where the
roles of workers and employers are reversed and employers are the demand
seeking population. These two additional use cases are non-exhaustive
and applications outside of employment are tenable and warranted.

To illustrate these two additional examples, we return to the synthetic
example initially introduced in
\protect\hypertarget{background}{}{Background} section.

\hypertarget{measuring-access-to-jobs-for-specialized-working-populations}{%
\subsection{Measuring access to jobs for specialized working
populations}\label{measuring-access-to-jobs-for-specialized-working-populations}}

Suppose that population centers P1 through P8 are not all eligible for
employment at the three employment centers E1, E2, and E3. This can be
due to education attainment or more simply a geographic barrier (i.e.,
river without a road) making it impossible for certain populations to be
employed at certain employment centers. In this synthetic example, we
consider that only population center P1 and P2 are eligible for
employment at employment center E1. Next assume that jobs in employment
center E2 can be taken by individuals in population centers P3, P4, P5,
P7, and P8. Lastly, jobs in employment center E3 require qualifications
available only among individuals in population centers P5, P6, P8, and
P9. In essence, eligibility criteria create catchments which can be
easily considered within the spatial availability measure and this
specialized job access is presented in Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-with-catchments-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}Spatial availability of jobs from population centers assuming catchment restrictions for the simple synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita} Spatial availability of jobs per capita for each population centers with catchment restrictions (top) and without catchment restrictions (bottom) for the synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}
\end{figure}

For higher interpretability, we can view Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita} which demonstrates a
plot of spatial availability per captia considering catchments and also
another plot which assumes the same number of employment center
opportunities and population but no catchments.

In the bottom plot of Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}, we see that
population center P5 has the highest level of spatial availability, due
to being a large population center that is more relatively close to
jobs. We also see population centers which are further from employment
centers have low spatial availability (P1, P3, P6, P7, P9) and
population centers which are more central have, evidently, higher job
access. We can also discern that the regional spatial availability per
capita is 0.908. In contrast, when catchments are introduced, as shown
in the top plot of Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}, we see that the job
access for population centers in the blue catchment decreases as job
competition increases. However, we also observe that access marginally
increases for the population centers in the yellow catchment and the
regional spatial availability per capita increases slightly to 0.964.

\hypertarget{measuring-access-to-workers-for-employment-centers}{%
\subsection{Measuring access to workers for employment
centers}\label{measuring-access-to-workers-for-employment-centers}}

In this use case, we remove the catchments and switch the demand and
opportunity roles of the employment centers and population centers. In
this way, the spatial availability measure reflects \emph{worker access}
by proportionally allocating \emph{workers} to employment centers based
on travel cost (i.e., distance) and population (i.e., jobs at each
employment center). Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job} presents spatial
availability generally and per capita for this use case.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-workers-per-job-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job} Spatial availability of workers for each employment center (top) and the spatial availability of workers per job for each employment center (bottom) for the simple synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job},
the top plot demonstrates the spatial availability which measures
\emph{worker access} for the three employment centers. As with all
spatial availability calculations, the number of all opportunities (in
this case \emph{workers}) are proportionally allocated to each
employment center so employment center E3, E2 and E1 have access to
2205.19, 1709.52, and 610.29 workers respectively. Again, this totals to
4500 workers in the area. In the bottom plot, these spatial availability
values are normalized per job (i.e.~the `population' of the employment
centers) and we can see that employment center E3 has an above average
worker access of 1.47 workers per job while E2 and E1 have 0.76 and 0.81
workers per job respectively.

\hypertarget{concluding-remarks-and-future-applications}{%
\section{Concluding remarks and future
applications}\label{concluding-remarks-and-future-applications}}

In this paper, we propose \emph{spatial availability} as an alternative
to conventional accessibility which measures opportunity access which
addressed the \emph{competition effect} and thus produces a meaningful
opportunity access measure which can be normalized per demand population
and used to compare access across regions. As a reminder, the
competition effect results in the over- and under- estimation of
opportunity access, under specific conditions, due to the
multiple-counting of opportunities which is embedded in accessibility's
method and thus makes comparing accessibility across regions potentially
biased . Spatial availability, however, proportionally allocates
opportunities based on the demand population and travel cost thus
constraining the number of opportunities allocated across the measured
region to the number of opportunities available. This single-sided
opportunity constraint can be said to only consider opportunity
competition for any magnitude of demand population (i.e., when measuring
job access per worker the number of workers (demanding population) does
not need to match the number of jobs (opportunities)). We demonstrate
the use of this measure and how it compares with accessibility in an
empirical example of workers and jobs in the GGH. We also demonstrate
two additional employment use cases for this versatile measure in a
hypothetical synthetic example. These data sets and examples highlight
how intuitive the per demand population access values are and captures
some of the extent to which accessibility overestimates and
underestimates access.

We acknowledge recent work to address limitations associated with the
accessibility measure; in this light, we propose that spatial
availability be seen as a type of spatial mismatch and an evolution of
the BFCA approach. Historically, literature has iteratively improved
measures assessing access to opportunities. In the context of employment
and healthcare opportunities, simple container counting solutions such
as the population-to-provider ratio (PPR) for healthcare services and
jobs to housing ratio were implemented. This approach, while straight
forward, is highly susceptible to the modifiable unit area problem
(MUAP). Recognizing this and harnessing the computation power and access
to finer resolution data as it became available, scholars proposed the
next evolution, namely the accessibility measure which is widely used
today and we implemented in our examples for comparison. It partially
addresses the MUAP by considering opportunities outside of the
conventional `containers' which represented opportunities in a census
areas/neighbourhoods by counting opportunities informed by an impedance
function based on travel cost. Our measure, spatial availability,
iterates on the accessibility measure by proportionally allocating
travel cost and population (workers) of origins to opportunities at
destinations. This single-constrained approach ensures that the
population is mutually exclusive in essence replicating the properties
of the self-contained unit which is \emph{not} limited to a zoning
system proposed; the pros of accessibility solution in using the
impedance function and pros of the container solutions.

However, similar to the accessibility measure, it should be noted that
spatial availability is only as robust to the MUAP as the input data
allows. For instance, in the empirical TTS data set, job access
calculated using accessibility and spatial availability still only
considers population, opportunities, and travel times from the centroids
of TAZ and those TAZ are vulnerable to MUAP. Even though spatial
availability can be can be meaningful calculated on a per population
basis because of the proportionality property (unlike accessibility) it
will still include issues of MUAP because of the input data. That said,
since spatial availability does not inconsistently multiple-counts
opportunities (like accessibility) it is not prone to replicating
existing MUAP issues. For this reason, spatial availability is more
robust to MUAP than the accessibility measure and this idea along with
other multi-scale dimensions of access such as scales, populations and
time-windows, will be explored in future papers.

Fundamentally, accessibility measure's methodology results in the
overestimation or underestimation of opportunity access as a result of
the competition effect. Accessibility does not include factors to bound
the summation so origins, hypothetically, can have infinite opportunity
access. Spatial availability includes a single-sided opportunity
constraint so it can be used to calculate access to any opportunity
type, whether competitive or non-competitive in natural. In this paper,
we only examined access to employment (or access to workers from the
perspective of employment centers), but any opportunities which are
competitive (i.e., a finite number of seats or capacity is available at
any given time) such as schools, hospitals, and other essential services
can be measured. Additionally, opportunities which are non-competitive
in the sense that they have always larger capacities than population can
still benefit from this measure as access will not be over or
underestimated as a result of the competition effect seen in
accessibility; non-competitive opportunities can include large natural
parks and beaches. As such, all access values measured for all
opportunities can benefit from spatial availability measure through the
reduction in competition effect (from accessibility) and a meaningful
per demand population benchmark.
