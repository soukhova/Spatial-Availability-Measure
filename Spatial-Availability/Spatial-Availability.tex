\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The concept of accessibility (opportunity access) is a relatively simple
one whose appeal derives from combining the spatial distribution of
opportunities and the cost of reaching them (Hansen, 1959). Numerous
methods for calculating \emph{opportunity access} have been proposed
that can be broadly organized into infrastructure-, place-, person-, and
utility-based measures (Geurs and van Wee, 2004). Of these, the
place-based family of measures is arguably the most common, capturing
the number of opportunities reachable from an origin using the
transportation network. This type of measure is also referred to as a
gravity-based measure of accessibility that captures the potential for
interaction.

\emph{Opportunity access} analysis is widely employed in transportation,
geography, public health, and many other areas, and there is increasing
emphasis on a shift from mobility-oriented to access-oriented planning
(Deboosere et al., 2018; Handy, 2020; Proffitt et al., 2017; Yan, 2021).
However, while these types of \emph{opportunity access} measures are
excellent indicators of the intersection between urban structure and
transportation infrastructure, they have been criticized in the past for
not being highly interpretable. Previous research has highlighted how
the weighting of opportunities using an impedance function can make
gravity measures more difficult for planners and policymakers to
interpret compared to simpler cumulative opportunity measures (Geurs and
van Wee, 2004; Miller, 2018). Moreover, because place-based access
measures sensitive to the number of opportunities and the
characteristics of the transportation network, raw accessibility values
cannot be easily compared across study areas (Allen and Farber, 2019).

Intra- and inter-regional comparisons are challenging because
gravity-based accessibility indicators are spatially smoothed estimates
of the total number of opportunities, however, the meaning of their
magnitudes is unclear. This is evident when we consider the ``total
accessibility'' in the region, a quantity that is not particularly
meaningful since it is not constrained to resemble, let alone match the
number of opportunities available. Furthermore, while accessibility
depends on the supply of destination opportunities weighted by the
travel costs associated with reaching them, the calculated
accessibilities are not sensitive to the demand for those opportunities
at the origins. Put another way, traditional measures of place-based
accessibility do not capture the competition for opportunities. This
theoretical shortcoming (Geurs and van Wee, 2004) is particularly
problematic when those opportunities are ``non-divisible'' in the sense
that, once they have been taken by someone, are no longer available to
other members of the population. Examples of indivisible opportunities
include jobs (when a person takes up a job, the same job cannot be taken
by someone else) and placements at schools (once a student takes a seat
at a school, that particular opportunity is no longer there for another
student). From a different perspective, employers may see workers as
opportunities, so when a worker takes a job, this particular individual
is no longer in the available pool of candidates for hiring.

To remedy these issues, researchers have proposed several different
approaches for calculating competitive \emph{opportunity access}. On the
one hand, this includes several approaches that first normalize the
number of opportunities available at a destination by the demand for
them from the origin zones and, second, sum the demand-corrected
opportunities which can be reached from the origins (e.g. Joseph and
Bantock, 1984; Shen, 1998). These advances were popularized in the
family of two-step floating catchment area methods (Luo and Wang, 2003)
that have found widespread adoption for calculating competitive
\emph{opportunity access} to healthcare and other uses. In principle
floating catchment areas purport to account for competition/congestion
effects, although in practice several researchers (e.g., Delamater,
2013; Wan et al., 2012) have found that they tend to over-estimate the
level of demand and/or service. The underlying issue, as demonstrated by
Paez et al. (2019), is the multiple counting of both population and
level of service, which can lead to biased estimates if not corrected.

A second approach is to impose constraints on the gravity model to
ensure flows between zones are equal to the observed totals. Based on
Wilson's (1971) entropy-derived gravity model, researchers can
incorporate constraints to ensure that the modeled flows match some
known quantities in the data inputs. In this way, models can be
singly-constrained to match the row- or column-marginals (the trips
produced or attracted, respectively), whereas a doubly-constrained model
is designed to match both marginals. Allen and Farber (2019) recently
incorporated a version of the doubly-constrained gravity model within
the floating catchment area approach to calculate competitive
\emph{opportunity access} to employment using transit across eight
cities in Canada. But while such a model can account for competition,
the mutual dependence of the balancing factors in a doubly-constrained
model means they must be iteratively calculated which makes them more
computationally-intensive. Furthermore, the double constraint means that
the sum of opportunity-seekers and the sum of opportunities must match,
which is not necessarily true in every case (e.g., there might be more
people searching for work than jobs exist in a region).

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to measuring
competitive \emph{opportunity access}. We call it a measure of
\textbf{spatial availability} (SA), and it aims to capture the number of
indivisible opportunities that are not only \emph{accessible} but also
\emph{available} to the opportunity-seeking population, in the sense
that they have not been claimed by a competing seeker of the
opportunity. As we will show, spatial availability is a
singly-constrained measure of accessibility. By allocating opportunities
in a proportional way based on demand and distance, this method avoids
the issues of conglomeration that result from multiple counting of
opportunities in traditional accessibility measures. The method returns
meaningful accessibilities that correspond to the rate of available
opportunities per person. Moreover, the method also returns a benchmark
value for the region under study against which results for individual
origins can be compared.

In the following sections we will describe and illustrate this new
measure using simple numerical examples. First, we will describe the
measure. Second, we will calculate the SA using a simple hypothetical
population and employment centers data set for three use-cases: one of
jobs from the perspective of the population, another considering
catchment restrictions, and another of workers from the perspective of
employers. Thirdly, we calculate the SA using real world data for the
Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) home-to-work commute in 2016 for
the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) area in Ontario, Canada. Finally, we
discuss the differences between accessibility estimates to the proposed
measure of SA and the potential range of uses of the SA measure.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

Most \emph{opportunity access} measures (excluding utility-based
measures) are derived from the gravity model, and are known as
\emph{gravity-based} accessibility. Briefly, consider the following
widely used accessibility measure \(A_i\) :

\[
A_i = \sum_{j=1}^JO_jf(c_{ij})
\]

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(i\) is a set of origin locations.
\item
  \(j\) is a set of destination locations.
\item
  \(O_j\) is the number of opportunities at location \(j\). These are
  opportunities for activity and add some sort of \emph{supply} to the
  area;
\item
  \(c_{ij}\) is a measure of the cost of moving between \(i\) and \(j\)
\item
  \(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function of \(c_{ij}\); it can take the
  form of any monotonically decreasing function such as a negative
  exponential, lognormal, or gamma .
\end{itemize}

The accessibility value \(A_i\) is the weighted sum of opportunities
that can be reached from location \(i\), given the cost of travel
\(c_{ij}\) and an impedance function. Summing the opportunities in the
neighborhood of \(i\) (the neighborhood is defined by the impedance
function) estimates of the total number of opportunities that can be
reached from \(i\) at a certain cost. Depending on the impedance
function, the measure could be cumulative opportunities (if \(f(\cdot)\)
is a binary or indicator function) or a more traditional gravity
measure, for instance with a Gaussian impedance function or an inverse
cost impedance function .

We use a simple numerical example to introduce the key concepts, and we
will use the usual accessibility measure for comparison. In this way, we
aim to show the differences between accessibility and spatial
availability, which helps to explain how spatial availability can
improve interpretability in the analysis of spatially dispersed
opportunities.

\hypertarget{numerical-example}{%
\subsection{Numerical Example}\label{numerical-example}}

In this section we present a simple numerical example. The setup for the
example is a system with three employment centers and nine population
centers, as seen in Table \ref{tab:toy-example}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:toy-example-table}\label{tab:toy-example}Numerical example}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lrl>{}l}
\toprule
id & number & type & \\
\midrule
E1 & 750 & jobs & \\

E2 & 2250 & jobs & \\

E3 & 1500 & jobs & \\

P1 & 260 & population & \\

P2 & 255 & population & \\

P3 & 510 & population & \\

P4 & 495 & population & \\

P5 & 1020 & population & \\

P6 & 490 & population & \\

P7 & 980 & population & \\

P9 & 255 & population & \multirow{-12}{*}{\raggedright\arraybackslash \includegraphics{images/figure-1.png}}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The accessibility to employment of each of the population centers can be
calculated using the expression above for \(A_i\). As noted, this yields
the number of jobs (opportunities) that are accessible (i.e., can be
reached) from each population center, given the cost. In this example we
use the straight line distance between the population and jobs for
\(c_{ij}\), and a negative exponential function with \(\beta = 0.0015\).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-accessibility-plot-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-accessibility}Accessibility results using simple numerical example}\label{fig:toy-example-accessibility-plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility} shows the three employment
centers locations (black circles), where the size of the symbol is in
proportion to the number of jobs at each location. We also see nine
population centers (triangles), where the size of the symbol is
proportional to the accessibility (\(A_i\)) to jobs. At a glance:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population centers (triangles) in the middle of the map are relatively
  close to all three employment centers and thus have the highest levels
  of job accessibility. Population center P5 is relatively central and
  close to all employment centers, and it is the closest population to
  the second largest employment center in the region. Unsurprisingly,
  this population center has the highest accessibility 680.64);
\item
  Population centers (triangles) near the left edge of the map (only in
  proximity to the small employment center) have the lowest levels of
  job accessibility. Population center P1 is quite peripheral and the
  closest employment center is also the smallest one. Consequently, it
  has the lowest accessibility with \(A_i=\) 17.12);
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-are-the-issues}{%
\subsection{What are the Issues?}\label{what-are-the-issues}}

Accessibility measures are excellent indicators of the intersection
between urban structure and transportation infrastructure. However,
beyond enabling comparisons of relative values they are not highly
interpretable on their own. For instance, from Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility}, P1 has lower accessibility than P5,
however, despite the accessibility value for P1 being low it is still
better than \emph{zero}. This evaluation leaves decision makers unclear
on how to interpret accessibility values, particularly extreme values
and particularly when comparing across scenarios or regions . The
obscurity in interpretation of accessibility values arises from the
following two ways.

First, origins with accessibility to a high density of opportunities are
susceptible to having disproportionately higher accessibility values
than origins with a lower density of opportunities. This occurs since
total accessibility (\(\sum_{i=1}^IA_i\)) depends on the number of
origins; every additional origin in the analysis causes at least one and
possibly more opportunities at destinations to be multiple-counted. As
opportunities are multiple-counted, origins which are in proximity to
high density of opportunities have accessibility values which are
relatively conglomerated compared to origins in proximity to a lower
density of opportunities. This issue means total accessibility is
vulnerable to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) as opportunities
and origins which are spatially aggregated are multiple-counted
inconsistently.

Second, the calculated accessibilities do not take competition into
account. For example, an individual at P5 has accessibility to
680.6373657 jobs. But since this is also a large population center,
there is potentially large competition for those accessible jobs. In
other words, the value of \(A_i\) is not sensitive to the size of
population at the origin seeking the opportunity (in this case jobs),
let alone the population at other locations. This unfortunately limits
the interpretability of the measure. Floating catchment areas purport to
account for competition/congestion effects, but as discussed by Paez,
Higgins, and Vivona (2019), they are vulnerable to conglomeration, which
makes them prone to bias unless corrected.

To address these two shortcomings of the accessibility measure, we
propose a singly-constrained gravity measure that corresponds to the
concept of \emph{spatial availability}.

\section{Spatial Availability: Proportional Allocation of Opportunities
Based on
Demand}\label{spatial-availability-proportional-allocation-of-opportunities-based-on-demand}}

\hypertarget{analytical-framework}{%
\subsection{Analytical Framework}\label{analytical-framework}}

As recent research on accessibility shows (see for instance Paez,
Higgins, Vivona (2019) and Allen and Farber (2019)), accounting for
competitive access in a meaningful way requires the proportional
allocations of quantities in the accessibility calculations, or their
normalization. At issue is the fact that multiple-counting is
commonplace when calculating conventional accessibility \(A_i\) for
\(i=1,\cdots,n\) as every opportunity enters the weighted sum once for
every origin \(i\) that can reach it. This has the unfortunate effect of
obscuring the interpretability of \(A_i\) and fails to answer for a
individual at a specific population center the question: \emph{``many
jobs are accessible, but the same jobs are also accessible to my
(possibly) numerous neighbors\ldots what does high accessibility
actually mean to me?''}

In the spatial availability framework proposed, and in line with the
gravity tradition, we distinguish between opportunities at a destination
and demand for opportunities at the origin. To explain the analytical
framework, the example of access to employment is illustrative, with
``population'' in the role of demand (i.e., the number of individuals in
the labour market who ``demand'' employment) and ``jobs'' in the role of
opportunities.

As an overview, spatial availability (\(V_{ij}\)) is the proportional
allocation of opportunities (\(O\)) and allocation factor for population
(\(f^p\)) and cost of travel (\(f^c\)). Since spatial availability
(\(V_{ij}\)) consists of these two allocation factors, this example
first details how the population allocation factor \(f^p_{ij}\) produces
\(V^p_{ij}\), next details the role of travel cost allocation factor
\(f^c_{ij}\) in producing \(V^c_{ij}\), and finally combines both
allocation factors in the final general form of spatial availability
\(V_{ij}\) as follows:

\[
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{f^p_{ij} \cdot f^c_{ij}}{\sum_{k=1}^K f^p_{kj} \cdot f^c_{kj}}
\]

\hypertarget{population-allocation-factor}{%
\subsubsection{Population Allocation
Factor}\label{population-allocation-factor}}

We begin with allocation based on demand; consider an employment center
\(j\) with \(O_j^r\) jobs of type \(r\). In the general case where there
are \(K\) population centers in the region, the following factor can be
defined:

\[
f^p_{ij} = \frac{P_{i\in r}^\alpha}{\sum_{k=1}^K P_{k\in r}^\alpha}
\]

\noindent On the right hand side of the equation, \(P_{i\in r}\) is the
population at location \(i\) that is eligible for jobs of type \(r\)
(maybe those with a certain level of training, or in a designated age
group). The summation in the bottom is over \(k=1,\cdots,K\), the number
of population centers in the region. The resulting factor \(f^p_{ij}\)
corresponds to the proportion of the population in zone \(i\) relative
to the rest of the region's population centres \(K\). The factors
\(f^p_{ij}\) satisfy the property that \(\sum_i^{I} f^p_{ij} = 1\). We
can also add an empirical parameter \(\alpha\) that can be used to
modulate the effect of size in the calculations (i.e., \(\alpha <1\)
places greater weight on smaller centres relative to larger ones while
\(\alpha>1\) achieves the opposite effect).

This factor (\(f^p_{ij}\)) can now be used to proportionally allocate a
share of the jobs at the employment centre \(j\) to population center
\(i\) and population center \(k\). The share of jobs at \(j\) allocated
to (i.e., available to) each population center is:

\[
V^p_{ij} = O_jf^p_{ij}\\
\]

\noindent and since \(\sum_i^{I} f^p_{ij} = 1\) it follows that:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^I V_{ij} = O_j 
\]

In other words, the number of jobs is preserved. The result is a
proportional allocation of available jobs to population centres based on
demand. As an example, consider an employment center \(j\) in a region
with two population centers (say \(i\) and \(k\)). For simplicity,
assume that the all the population in the region is eligible for these
jobs, that is, that the entirety of the population is included in the
set \(r\). The allocation factors for the jobs at \(j\) would be:

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
f^p_{ij} = \frac{P_i ^\alpha}{P_i^\alpha + P_k^\alpha}\\
f^p_{kj} = \frac{P_k^\alpha}{P_i^\alpha + P_k^\alpha}\\
\end{array}
\]

Suppose that there are three hundred jobs in the employment center
(\(W_j = 300\)), and that the populations are \(P_i=240\) and
\(P_k=120\). The jobs are allocated as follows (assuming that
\(\alpha=1\)):

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
V^p_{ij} = O_jf^p_{ij} = O_j\frac{P_i^\alpha}{P_i^\alpha + P_k^\alpha} = 300\frac{240}{240 + 120} = 300\frac{240}{360} = 200\\
V^p_{kj} = O_jf^p_{kj} = O_j\frac{P_k^\alpha}{P_i^\alpha + P_k^\alpha} = 300\frac{120}{240 + 120} = 300\frac{120}{360} = 100 \\
\end{array}
\]

It can be seen that proportionally more jobs are allocated to the bigger
center and also that the total number of jobs is preserved. However, the
factors above account for the total number of opportunities at the
destination (i.e., the number of jobs at the employment center), but
they do not account for their location relative to the population
centers. The proportional allocation procedure above is insensitive to
how far population centers \(i\) or \(k\) are from employment center
\(j\). To account for this effect we define a second set of allocation
factors based on distance to the employment centers.

\hypertarget{travel-cost-allocation-factor}{%
\subsubsection{Travel Cost Allocation
Factor}\label{travel-cost-allocation-factor}}

These are defined as:

\[
f^c_{ij} = \frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^K f(c_{ij})}\\
\]

\noindent where \(c_{ij}\) is the cost (e.g., the distance, travel time,
etc.) from population center \(i\) to employment center \(j\), and
\(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function that is a monotonically decreasing
function of cost (\(c_{ij}\)); in other words, this allocation factor
(\(f^c_{ij}\)) serves to proportionally allocates more jobs to closer
locations through an impedance function. To illustrate, assume that the
impedance function is a negative exponential function as follows, and
assume that \(\beta\) (which modulates the steepness of the impedance
effect and is an empirical parameter) is the value of 1:

\[
f(c_{ij}) = \exp(-\beta c_{ij})\\
\]

Continuing the example, suppose that the distance from population center
\(i\) to employment center \(j\) is 0.6 km, and the distance from
population center \(k\) to employment center \(j\) is 0.3 km. Being
closer, we would expect more jobs to be allocated to the population of
\(k\). The jobs would be sorted as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
f^c_{ij} = \frac{\exp(-\beta D_{ij})}{\exp(-\beta D_{ij}) + \exp(-\beta D_{kj})}\\
f^c_{kj} = \frac{\exp(-\beta D_{kj})}{\exp(-\beta D_{ij}) + \exp(-\beta D_{kj})}\\
\end{array}
\]

This step normalizes the impedance between \(i\) and \(j\) and \(k\) and
\(j\) by the total impedance in the study area. Numerically, the jobs
allocation is:

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
V^c_{ij} = O_jf^c_{ij} = O_j\frac{\exp(-D_{ij})}{\exp(-D_{ij}) + \exp(-D_{kj})} = 300\frac{\exp(-0.6)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 3\times 0.426 = 127.8\\
V^c_{kj} = O_jf^c_{kj} =  O_j\frac{\exp(-D_{kj})}{\exp(-D_{ij}) + \exp(-D_{kj})} = 300\frac{\exp(-0.3)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 3\times  0.574 = 172.2\\
\end{array}
\]

A larger share of jobs (172.2 jobs) is allocated to the population
center (\(k\)) that is closest as assumed. As before, the sum of jobs
allocated to the population centers matches the total number of jobs
available. Nevertheless, in isolation, this step does not account for
the allocation of jobs based on demand.

\hypertarget{putting-spatial-availability-together}{%
\subsubsection{Putting Spatial Availability
Together}\label{putting-spatial-availability-together}}

We can combine the proportional allocation factors by population and
distance and calculated spatial availability (\(V_{ij}\)) as follows:

\[
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{f^p_{ij} \cdot f^c_{ij}}{\sum_{k=1}^K f^p_{kj} \cdot f^c_{kj}}
\]

When applied to the example of population center \(i\) and \(k\) (i.e.,
the demand) traveling to employment center \(j\) (i.e., the opportunity
\(O\)):

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
V_{ij} = O_j\cdot \frac{f^p_{ij} \cdot f^c_{ij}}{f^p_{ij} \cdot f^c_{ij} + f^p_{kj} \cdot f^c_{kj}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)} = \big(300 \big)\big(\frac{0.284}{0.475} \big)= 179.4\\
V_{kj} = O_j\cdot \frac{f^p_{kj} \cdot f^c_{kj}}{f^p_{ij} \cdot f^c_{ij} + f^p_{ik} \cdot f^c_{ik}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}  = \big(300 \big)\big(\frac{0.191}{0.475} \big)= 120.6 \\
\end{array}
\]

Notice how fewer jobs are allocated to population center \(i\) compared
to the allocation by population only, to account for the higher cost of
reaching the employment center. On the other hand, distance alone
allocated more jobs to the closest population center (i.e., \(k\)), but
since it is smaller, it also gets a smaller share of the jobs overall.
Again, the sum of jobs at employment center \(j\) that are allocated to
population centers \(i\) and \(k\) simultaneously based on
\emph{population-} and \emph{distance-} based allocation is preserved
(i.e., \(W_{ij} + W_{kj} = W_j\)).

Availability is simply the sum of the above by origin:

\[
V_i = \sum_{j=1}^J V_{ij}
\]

This quantity represents opportunities (e.g., jobs) that can be reached
from \(i\) (i.e., they are accessible), and that are \emph{not}
allocated to a competitor: therefore the weighted sum of available
opportunities. Compare \(V_i\) to the singly-constrained gravity model
(see Wilson (1971)). In essence, \(V_i\) is the result of constraining
\(A_i\) to match one of the marginals in the origin-destination table,
the known total of opportunities.

Since the sum of opportunities is preserved in the procedures above, it
is possible to calculate a highly interpretable measure of spatial
availability per capita (call it lower-case \(v_i\)) as follows:

\[
v_i = \frac{V_i}{P_i}
\]

In the example above:

\[
\begin{array}{l}\
v_{ij} = \frac{V_{ij}}{P_i} =  \frac{179.4}{240}\\
v_{kj} =  \frac{V_{ik}}{P_k} =  \frac{120.6}{120}\\
\end{array}
\]

Less competition (\(P_k\) is the smallest population center in the
region) and being closer to the jobs clearly works in favor of
individuals at \(k\). Where the overall ratio of jobs to population in
the region is \(300/(240 + 120)=\) 0.83, the spatially available jobs
per capita at \(k\) is closer to unity.

In the following sections we use the same numerical example presented
above to illustrate how availability \(V_i\) is calculated. We conclude
by contrasting the two measures in the final section.

\subsection{1st Use Case: Available Jobs for The Working
Population}\label{st-use-case-available-jobs-for-the-working-population}}

In the following examples we use the same impedance function that was
used to illustrate the accessibility calculations in the numerical
example. The spatial availability calculations are implemented in the
function \texttt{sp\_avail}. The inputs are an Origin-Destination table
with labels for the origins (\texttt{o\_id}), labels for the
destinations (\texttt{d\_id}), the population (\texttt{pop)} and number
of opportunities (\texttt{opp}), an indicator for catchments or other
eligibility constraints (\texttt{r}), and a pre-calculated impedance
function (\texttt{f}). For this example, we assume that there are no
catchment restrictions by setting \texttt{r} to 1.

The value of the function (its output) is a vector with \(V_ij\) given
the inputs, that is, the opportunities available to \(i\) from \(j\):

Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs} shows the estimates of
spatial availability:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-jobs-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs}Spatial availability of jobs}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs}
\end{figure}

We see that population center 5 has the highest level of spatial
availability, due to being a large population center that is moreover
relatively close to jobs. To improve the interpretability of this
measure, we first note that the regional measure of jobs per capita is
0.994. We then calculate the spatially available jobs per person by
dividing each spatial availability value by the population at each
population center (Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}).

Some population centers have almost two jobs available per person
(compared to the overall regional value of approximately one job per
person), while others have less than one job available per person. This
does not mean that people are not taking some of the jobs. It means that
controlling for the cost of reaching jobs, they are worse off than those
with more jobs spatially available.

\hypertarget{nd-use-case-available-jobs-for-specialized-working-populations}{%
\subsection{2nd Use Case: Available Jobs for Specialized Working
Populations}\label{nd-use-case-available-jobs-for-specialized-working-populations}}

In this section we introduce catchment/eligibility constraints. Due to
differences in educational achievement among the population, the jobs in
Employment Center 1 can only be taken by individuals in population
centers 1 and 2. Jobs in Employment Center 2 can be taken by individuals
in population centers 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Lastly, jobs in Employment
Center 3 require qualifications available only among individuals in
population centers 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculate the spatial availability by proportionally allocating
\emph{specialized} workers to jobs (we refer to spatial availability in
this case as \(V_ij_r\)):

Plot the availability estimates:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-with-catchments-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}Spatial availability of jobs with catchment restrictions}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}
\end{figure}

Available jobs per person with catchment/eligibility conditions:

The plot in Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments-per-capita} shows the
availability per person without and with catchment restrictions.

\end{figure}

We can see that when there are catchment restrictions population center
2, despite being relatively peripheral, has higher spatial availability
due to spatial specialization. With catchments, the spatial availability
of jobs declines from the perspective of population center 4: the
population here has skills required for jobs at a small employment
center, where they face substantial competition from other population
centers.

Centers}\label{rd-use-case-available-workers-for-employment-centers}}

We can also examine the pool of workers available to each employment
center by considering the workers as the opportunities and the jobs as
the population.

Calculate the spatial availability by proportionally allocating jobs to
workers (we refer to spatial availability in this case as \(W_ji\)) as

Jobs in
Toronto}\label{empirical-example-spatial-availability-and-accessibility-of-jobs-in-toronto}}

For the reasons demonstrated in the hypothetical toy example; the
spatial availability measure produces different and more interpretable
results than accessibility. In this section we will demonstrate both
measures and a comparison using empirical data for home-based work trips
to places of employment in Toronto, Ontario.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) data for 20 municipalities
contained within the the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) area in the
province of Ontario, Canada (43.6°N 79.73°W) is analysed (Figure
\ref{fig:TTS-16-survey-area}). This data set includes home-based origins
and employment destinations defined by centroids of Traffic Analysis
Zones (TAZ) of varying areas (n=3764), the number of jobs (n=3081900)
and workers (n=3446957) at each origin and destination, and the trips
from origin to destination for the morning home-to-work commute
(n=3446957). Also included are calculated travel times by car
(calculated via \href{https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r}{\texttt{r5r}}) and
a derived impedance function values corresponding to the cost of travel
based on the trip length distribution (TLD). The descriptive statistics
are presented in Table \ref{tab:TTS-16-desc-stats} and a

\subsection{Calibrating an Impedance
Function}\label{calibrating-an-impedance-function}}

In the hypothetical toy data set, an arbitrary negative exponential
function describing the increase in travel cost as distance increases
was used as the impedance function to derive both accessibility and
availability. In this data set, an impedance function can be derived
from the empirical trip length distribution (TLD) as the number of trips
and their travel cost (in the case, travel time in minutes) are known
(see black data points in Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}).

The TLD density plot appears to follow a gamma distribution, as such,
this theoretical distribution along with other common TLD distributions
such as log-normal and exponential distributions were fitted to the
empirical TLD using the maximum likelihood estimation method and
Nelder-Mead method for direct optimization available within the
fitdistrplus package in R (Delignette-Muller and Dutang, 2015;
\textbf{R\_2021?}) . Based on goodness-of-fit criteria, the gamma
distribution was selected (see red line in Figure
\ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}). The gamma distribution function is given in
the following general form: \[ 
f(x, \alpha, \beta) = \frac {x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}}{ \beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq \infty
\] \noindent where the estimated `shape' is \(\alpha\),the estimated
`rate' is \(\beta\), and \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is defined as:

\[
\Gamma(\alpha) =  \int_{0}^{\infty} x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x} \,dx
\]

\end{figure}

The calibrated impedance function has a shape parameter of 2.019 and a
rate parameter of 0.094. The function and diagnostics are plotted in
Figure \ref{fig:impedance-function-plot} and the predicted values are
plotted alongside the empirical TLD in Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}.
As a point of summary, values calculated by this calibrated impedance
function captures our theoretical cost of travel (i.e.~probability of
travel based on the trip length distribution of empirical trips and
associated travel time) within the following accessibility and spatial
availability calculations.

\hypertarget{accessibility-and-spatial-availability-of-jobs-in-toronto}{%
\subsection{Accessibility and Spatial Availability of Jobs in
Toronto}\label{accessibility-and-spatial-availability-of-jobs-in-toronto}}

Using the impedance function defined, the accessibility to employment
destinations in Toronto from home-based origins anywhere in the GGH is
calculated. The higher the accessibility value, the more accessible
places of employment are to home-based origins as seen in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-accessibility-Toronto-TTS}. It can be briefly summarized
that the that the accessibility values follow a radial trend where the
majority of TAZs in Toronto have high accessibility values and values
decrease in TAZs which are further from the city boundary.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-accessibility-Toronto-TTS-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-accessibility-Toronto-TTS}Calculated accessibility of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the City of Toronto}\label{fig:plot-accessibility-Toronto-TTS}
\end{figure}

Next, the spatial availability using the same impedance function is
calculated for the same survey area; the higher the spatial availability
value the more available employment destinations in Toronto are to any
home-based origins in the GGH (Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS}).
If a TAZ has a spatial availability value which is higher or lower than
637.813 it has above or below average spatial availability of jobs
relative to all job opportunities within the City of Toronto (for all
origins in the GGH). Spatial availability can also be normalized per
workers within each TAZ to provide meaningful insight on how many jobs
are \emph{available} on average for each TAZ. This normalization, shown
in Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS-per-worker}, demonstrates
which TAZ have above and below the average (0.422) available jobs per
worker in the GGH (to jobs located within the city of Toronto). It can
be briefly summarized that the spatial availability measure has a
smaller and less pronounced radial impact than the accessibility
measure; TAZs within and immediately outside the boundary of Toronto
have above average spatial availability of jobs but at a lower relative
intensity than compared to the availability measure. Additionally, more
TAZs outside of Toronto have low spatial availability values.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\hypertarget{comparing-job-access-measures}{%
\subsection{Comparing Job Access
Measures}\label{comparing-job-access-measures}}

Accessibility and spatial availability in our example both measure
\emph{access to jobs}. However, these two measures cannot be
meaningfully compared through normalization on a per worker basis since
the accessibility methodology inherently multiple-counts opportunities.
We thus take a different approach to compare the relative magnitudes
(within each measure) by re-scaling both measures from 0 to 100 where
each value of the measure is divided by the maximum value. The
percentage change between re-scaled spatial availability and
accessibility for each TAZ is then calculated;98.9\% of TAZs have lower
re-scaled spatial availability values than accessibility values and they
are on average -80.64\% different and range between -2.95\% to -99.9\%
different than re-scaled accessibility. To simplify the presentation of
percentage change in difference between measures, five quantiles are
calculated and coloured to represent each TAZ in Figure
\ref{fig:indexed-measures-comparison-plot}. The quantile ranks range
from 1 to 5 where 1 represents the highest percentage difference between
spatial availability and accessibility. In other words, the higher the
quantile rank, the more pronounced the overestimation of \emph{job
access} is in that TAZ when referring to the accessibility measure
relative to the spatial availability measure. It should be noted that
the 1.1\% of TAZs which experience a positive change between the
rescaled measures are shown in grey.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/indexed-measures-comparison-plot-1} \caption{\label{fig:indexed-measures-comparison-plot}Difference in rescaled accessbility and spatial availability values in the context of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the City of Toronto. TAZs with rescaled spatial accessibility values that are lower than rescaled accessibility values are presented in five quantiles from 1 to 5 with 1 representing the highest negetative change between spatial availability and accessibility. TAZs with values which are higher than rescaled accessibility are shown in grey.}\label{fig:indexed-measures-comparison-plot}
\end{figure}

We can see from Figure \ref{fig:indexed-measures-comparison-plot} that
when we re-scale the accessibility values, they consistently
overestimate \emph{job access} compared to the re-scaled spatial
availability measure. Overestimation ranges from -3\% to -100\% and is
on average -81\%. However, while accessibility consistently
overestimates \emph{job access} relative to spatial availability, it
does so in a variable way. \emph{Job access} is more overestimated in
TAZs that have a low number of workers and is less overestimated in TAZs
with a high number of workers; the correlation between the number of
workers and the percentage difference between measures is 0.877. As
such, the TAZs that have a relatively low number of workers are located
between the border of the GGH and the City of Toronto and are also
mostly coloured by red and orange indicating Quantiles 1 and 2 (highest
percentage of overestimation) and vice versa. Both \emph{job access}
measures are more similar when the number of workers correlates with
travel cost and the number of jobs at the destination. However, when the
calibrated travel cost outpaces the number of workers, as is the case
for the low-worker TAZs within this empirical example, then these
measures increasingly diverge. This difference emphasizes the importance
in using an accurate and well-informed impedance function and
origin-destination data. For reference to these trends, the plots for
workers and impedance function values for all TAZs are presented in
Figure \ref{fig:plot-workers-imp}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-workers-imp-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-workers-imp}Number of workers (top) and average impedance function value (bottom) for each origin TAZ in the GGH.}\label{fig:plot-workers-imp}
\end{figure}

Accessibility when used to measure \emph{job access} obscures the
\emph{availability} of jobs. Overall, this can be seen when comparing
Figure \ref{fig:plot-accessibility-Toronto-TTS} and Figure
\ref{fig:plot-avail-Toronto-TTS} where the intra-measure magnitude of
accessibility is much higher within and closer to the boundary of the
City of Toronto while spatial availability is more level as it is
proportioned by the number of workers within each origin TAZs. Since
spatial availability is proportioned by the number of workers, the
resulting \emph{job access} value is numerically meaningful to determine
what \emph{job access} is available per worker and how it compares to
the average \emph{job access} for the region. In this way, spatial
availability is more interpretable than accessibility as it can be
stated that the average Toronto jobs per worker is XX for the GGH and XX
for Toronto; interestingly, all TAZs in Toronto have a higher \emph{job
access} than the GGH value but still range between XX and XX.

\hypertarget{contextualizing-spatial-availability-use-cases}{%
\subsection{Contextualizing Spatial Availability Use
Cases}\label{contextualizing-spatial-availability-use-cases}}

With the toy and empirical example presented, we propose that spatial
availability be seen as a type of \emph{spatial mismatch} and an
evolution of the \emph{balanced floating catchment} approach (BFCA) .
Historically, literature has iteratively improved measures assessing
access to opportunities. In the context of employment and healthcare
opportunities, simple container counting solutions such as the
population-to-provider ratio (PPR) for healthcare services and jobs to
housing ratio were implemented. This approach, while straight forward,
is highly sustible to the modifiable unit area problem (MUAP).
Recognizing this and harnessing the computation power and access to
finer resolution data as it became available, scholars proposed the next
evolution, namely the accessibility measure which is widely used today
and we implemented in our examples for comparison. It partially
addresses the MUAP by considering opportunities outside of the
conventional `containers' which represented opportunities in a census
areas/neighbourhoods by counting opportunities informed by an impedance
function based on travel cost. Our measure, spatial availability,
iterates on the accessibility measure by proportionally allocating
travel cost and population (workers) of origins to opportunities at
destinations. This single-constrained approach ensures that the
population is mutually exclusive in essence replicating the properties
of the self-contained unit which is \emph{not} limited to a zoning
system proposed; the pros of accessibility solution in using the
impedance function and pros of the container solutions.

Similar to the accessibility measure, it should be noted that spatial
availability is only as robust to the MUAP as the input data allows. For
instance, in the empirical example present, the measure of \emph{job
access} still only considers population, opportunities, and travel times
from the centroids of TAZs. However, unlike the accessibility measure,
spatial availability can be meaningful calculated on a per population
basis at higher resolutions because of the proportionality property.

Further, the measure of spatial availability can be a useful way to
distinguish between low accessibility/low population centers, which may
enjoy higher availability than the accessibility value may suggest, and
contrariwise, high accessibility/high population centers (which
potentially can result in lower availability due to competition). For
instance, as presented in the numerical example, more remote, smaller
population centers can have sufficient spatial availability by being in
close proximity to the smaller employment centers; however this
sufficiency is obscured by accessibility measure by conglomerating
accessibly of population centers which are more central to more (and
larger) employment centers. Conversely, referring to the empirical GGH
example, the TAZs that are relatively close to the Toronto job
destinations but have a relatively low number of workers receive
sufficiently high values of accessibility and signficantly lower spatial
availability values; this trend is opposite to what is experienced in
the numerical example and is a result of higher job competition
(i.e.~job opportunities are more highly allocated to TAZs with lower
travel costs and higher worker populations). Measuring access to
opportunities is a multi-scale problem; since the number of
opportunities are preserved, different scales, populations, and
time-windows can be incorporated within the measure without introducing
additional spatial basis.

Fundamentally, accessibility measure's methodology results in the
overestimation of \emph{jobs access} since it simply sums the count of
destination opportunities based on travel cost to opportunities; the
measure does not include factors to bound the summation so origins,
hypothetically, can have infinite \emph{opportunity access}. This
property can be practical for calculating \emph{opportunity access} for
opportunities which have large capacities and are \emph{non-competitive}
such as large natural parks and beaches. These non-competitive
opportunities can be considered infinitely divisible as they offer more
`spots' at any given time than the population. However, often times
opportunities are not divisible but are in fact indivisible and
competitive meaning, such as the numerical and GGH empirical example of
\emph{jobs access}, where only 1 worker can access 1 job at any given
time. In these cases, spatial availability measure can be used to
calculate the \emph{opportunity access} in which the report values are
numerically meaningful, the MUAP is potentially addressed, and
\emph{opportunity access} values across regions, neighbourhoods, and
spatial scales can be compared.
