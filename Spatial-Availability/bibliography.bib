	abstract = {Modern approaches to the modeling of transport demand imply the use of calibration procedures during the origin-destination (O-D) matrix estimation or transit assignment. These procedures lead to misrepresenting generated and attracted trips or changing the trip length distribution ({TLD}). It means that the methods of transport planning can be improved by means of determination, validation and implementation of the {TLD} to calculate the O-D matrix. The analysis of research results in the field of mass transit reveals an explicit similarity between {TLD} in different cities and the gamma distribution. It points to general regularities in various systems of mass transit that lead to the similarity in {TLD}. The regularities are determined by studying the spatial distribution of mass transit stops, which are considered trip origins and destinations. The experimental research was conducted in 10 Ukrainian cities using probability theory methods.},
