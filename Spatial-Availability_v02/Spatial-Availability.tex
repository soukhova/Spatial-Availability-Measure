  Accessibility measures are widely used in transportation, urban, and
  healthcare planning, among other applications. These measures are
  weighted sums of the opportunities that can be reached given the cost
  of movement and are interpreted to represent the potential for spatial
  interaction. Though useful to understanding spatial structure, recent
  research on balanced floating catchment areas (BFCA) and competitive
  measures of accessibility raises questions about their
  interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new measure of
  \emph{spatial availability} which is calculated by imposing a single
  constraint on gravity-based accessibility. Similar to the gravity
  model from which spatial availability is derived, a single constraint
  ensures that a single set of marginals are met and thus the number of
  opportunities are preserved. Through examples, we detail the
  formulation of the proposed measure. Further, we use data from the
  2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of the Greater Golden Horseshoe
  area in southern Ontario, Canada, to contrast how the conventional
  accessibility measure tends to overestimate and underestimate the
  number of jobs \emph{available} to workers. We conclude with some
  discussion on the possible uses of spatial availability and argue
  that, compared to conventional measures of accessibility, it can offer
  a more meaningful and interpretable measure of opportunity access. All
  data and code used in this research are openly available.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The concept of accessibility is a relatively simple one whose appeal
derives from combining the spatial distribution of opportunities and the
cost of reaching them (Hansen, 1959). Numerous methods for calculating
accessibility have been proposed that can be broadly organized into
infrastructure-, place-, person-, and utility-based measures (Geurs and
van Wee, 2004). Of these, the place-based family of measures is arguably
the most common, capturing the number of opportunities reachable from an
origin using the transportation network. A common type of placed-based
measure is the gravity measure of accessibility that captures the
potential for interaction; since it was first developed by Hansen (1959)
it has been widely adopted by literature in many forms (e.g., Cervero et
al., 2002; Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Handy and Niemeier, 1997; Levinson,
1998; Paez, 2004).

Accessibility analysis is employed in transportation, geography, public
health, and many other areas, particularly as mobility-based planning is
de-emphasized in favor of access-oriented planning (Deboosere et al.,
2018; Handy, 2020; Proffitt et al., 2017; Yan, 2021). However, while
measures of accessibility are excellent indicators of the intersection
between urban structure and transportation infrastructure, their
interpretability has been criticized in the past. Previous research has
highlighted how the weighting of opportunities using an impedance
function can make gravity measures more difficult for planners and
policymakers to interpret compared to simpler cumulative opportunity
measures (Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Miller, 2018). Moreover, because
place-based measures are sensitive to the number of opportunities and
the size of the opportunity-seeking population (e.g., a large city has
more nearby jobs and more job-seekers than a smaller city), raw values
cannot be easily compared across study areas (Allen and Farber, 2019).

For this reason, place-based intra- and inter-regional comparisons of
accessibility are challenging to interpret. While gravity-based
accessibility indicators are spatially smoothed estimates of the total
number of opportunities, the meaning of their magnitudes is unclear.
This is evident when we consider the ``total accessibility'' in the
region, a quantity that is not particularly meaningful since it is not
constrained to resemble, let alone match, the number of opportunities
available. Furthermore, while accessibility depends on the number of
opportunities weighted by the travel costs associated with reaching
them, the calculated accessibilities are not sensitive to the demand for
those opportunities at the origins.

Put another way, traditional measures of place-based accessibility do
not capture the competition for opportunities. This shortcoming (Geurs
and van Wee, 2004) is particularly acute when opportunities are
``non-divisible'' in the sense that, once taken they are no longer
available to other members of the population. Examples of these types of
opportunities include jobs (when a person takes up a job, the same job
cannot be taken by anyone else) and placements at schools (once a
student takes a seat at a school, that particular opportunity is no
longer available for another student). From a different perspective,
employers may see workers as opportunities, so when a worker takes a
job, this particular individual is no longer in the available pool of
candidates for hiring.

To remedy these issues, researchers have proposed several different
approaches for calculating competitive accessibility values. On the one
hand, this includes several approaches that first normalize the number
of opportunities available at a destination by the demand for them from
the origin zones and, second, sum the demand-corrected opportunities
which can be reached from the origins (e.g. Joseph and Bantock, 1984;
Shen, 1998). These advances were popularized in the family of two-step
floating catchment area (FCA) methods (Luo and Wang, 2003) that have
found widespread adoption for calculating competitive accessibility to a
variety of opportunities such as healthcare, education, and food access
(B. Y. Chen et al., 2020; Chen, 2019; Z. Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
2006; Ye et al., 2018). In principle, floating catchments purport to
account for competition/congestion effects, although in practice several
researchers (e.g., Delamater, 2013; Wan et al., 2012) have found that
they tend to over-estimate the level of demand and/or service. The
underlying issue, as demonstrated by Paez et al. (2019), is the multiple
counting of both population and level of service, which can lead to
biased estimates if not corrected.

A second approach is to impose constraints on the gravity model to
ensure flows between zones are equal to the observed totals. Based on
Wilson's (1971) entropy-derived gravity model, researchers can
incorporate constraints to ensure that the modeled flows match some
known quantities in the data inputs. In this way, models can be
singly-constrained to match the row- or column-marginals (the trips
produced or attracted, respectively), whereas a doubly-constrained model
is designed to match both marginals. Allen and Farber (2019) recently
incorporated a version of the doubly-constrained gravity model within
the floating catchment area approach to calculate competitive
accessibility to employment using transit across eight cities in Canada.
But while such a model can account for competition, the mutual
dependence of the balancing factors in a doubly-constrained model means
they must be iteratively calculated which makes them more
computationally-intensive. Furthermore, the double constraint means that
the sum of opportunity-seekers and the sum of opportunities must match,
which is not necessarily true in every potential use case (e.g., there
might be more people searching for work than jobs exist in a region).

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to measuring
competitive accessibility. We call it a measure of \textbf{spatial
availability}, and it aims to capture the number of opportunities that
are not only \emph{accessible} but also \emph{available} to the
opportunity-seeking population, in the sense that they have not been
claimed by a competing seekers of the opportunity. As we will show,
spatial availability is a singly-constrained measure of accessibility.
By allocating opportunities in a proportional way based on demand and
distance, this method avoids the issues that result from multiple
counting of opportunities in conventional accessibility analysis. The
method returns meaningful accessibility estimates that correspond to the
rate of available opportunities per opportunity-seeking population.
Moreover, the method also returns a benchmark value for the region under
study against which results for individual origins can be compared both
inter- and intra-regionally.

In the following sections we will describe and illustrate the proposed
measure using a synthetic example and an empirical example. First, we
will describe the analytical framework of the measure. Second, we
calculate the spatial availability using data from the Transportation
Tomorrow Survey (TTS) home-to-work commute in 2016 for the Greater
Golden Horse (GGH) area in Ontario, Canada, and discuss differences with
conventional unconstrained accessibility analysis. Third, we return to
the synthetic example and calculate spatial availability for two
additional use-cases: one use case for jobs from the perspective of the
population considering catchment restrictions and another use case for
workers from the perspective of employers. Finally, we conclude by
discussing the advantages of the spatial availability measure and the
breadth of potential uses.

In the spirit of openness of research in the spatial sciences (Brunsdon
and Comber, 2021; Páez, 2021) this paper has a companion open data
product (Arribas-Bel et al., 2021), and all code will be available for
replicability and reproducibility purposes.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

Most accessibility measures (excluding utility-based measures) are
derived from the gravity model and follow the formulation shown in
Equation (\ref{eq:conventional-accessibility}). The limitations
associated with this conventional and widely used measure, namely issues
in interpretation and spatial bias, are the motivation for the proposed
\emph{spatial availability} measure. We begin this section by
conceptually demonstrating the issues associated with the conventional
accessibility measure using a simple synthetic example. We introduce the
analytical framework of spatial availability and highlight the
differences between the measures to demonstrate how the proposed method
improves the interpretability of opportunity access.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conventional-accessibility}
A_i = \sum_{j=1}^JO_jf(c_{ij})
\end{equation}

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A\) is accessibility.
\item
  \(i\) is a set of origin locations.
\item
  \(j\) is a set of destination locations.
\item
  \(O_j\) is the number of opportunities at location \(j\). These are
  opportunities for activity and add some sort of \emph{supply} to the
  area;
\item
  \(c_{ij}\) is a measure of the cost of moving between \(i\) and \(j\)
\item
  \(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function of \(c_{ij}\); it can take the
  form of any monotonically decreasing function chosen based on positive
  or normative criteria (Paez et al., 2012).
\end{itemize}

As formally defined, accessibility \(A_i\) is the weighted sum of
opportunities that can be reached from location \(i\), given the cost of
travel \(c_{ij}\). Summing the opportunities in the neighborhood of
\(i\), as determined by the impedance function \(f(\cdot)\), provides
estimates of the number of opportunities that can be reached from \(i\)
at a certain cost. The type of accessibility can be modified depending
on the impedance function; for example, the measure could be cumulative
opportunities (if \(f(\cdot)\) is a binary or indicator function e.g.,
El-Geneidy et al., 2016; Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Qi et al., 2018; Rosik
et al., 2021) or a gravity measure using an impedance function modeled
after any monotonically decreasing function {[}e.g., Gaussian, inverse
power, negative exponential, or log-normal, among others; see,
\emph{inter alia}, Kwan (1998); Vale and Pereira (2017); Reggiani et al.
(2011); Li et al. (2020){]}. In practice, the accessibility measures
derived from many cumulative and gravity formulations tend to be highly
correlated with one another (Higgins, 2019; Santana Palacios and
El-geneidy, 2022).

\hypertarget{accessibility-numerical-example}{%
\subsection{Synthetic example}\label{accessibility-numerical-example}}

The setup for our synthetic example is a system with three employment
centers and nine population centers, as summarized in Table
\ref{tab:toy-example}. Accessibility to jobs at each population center
is calculated using the accessibility measure \(A_i\) in Equation
(\ref{eq:conventional-accessibility}). In this simple example, we use
the straight line distance between the population and jobs for
\(c_{ij}\) and a negative exponential function with \(\beta = 0.0015\).
As noted, \(A_i\) represents the number of jobs (i.e., opportunities)
that can be reached from each population center given the estimated cost
as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility} shows the locations of the
three employment centers (black circles), where the size of the symbol
is in proportion to the number of jobs at each location. We also see
nine population centers (triangles), where the size of the symbol is
proportional to the accessibility (\(A_i\)) to jobs. The accessibility
values illustrates the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population centers (triangles) in the middle of the plot are
  relatively close to all three employment centers and thus have the
  highest levels of job accessibility. Population center P5 is
  relatively central and close to all employment centers, and it is the
  closest population to the second largest employment center in the
  region. Unsurprisingly, this population center has the highest
  accessibility 680.64);
\item
  Population centers (triangles) near the left edge of the map (only in
  proximity to the small employment center) have the lowest levels of
  job accessibility. Population center P1 is quite peripheral and the
  closest employment center is also the smallest one. Consequently, it
  has the lowest accessibility with \(A_i=\) 17.12);
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-effect-of-competition-for-opportunities}{%
\subsection{The effect of competition for
opportunities}\label{the-effect-of-competition-for-opportunities}}

Accessibility measures are excellent indicators of the intersection
between urban structure and transportation infrastructure (Kwan, 1998;
Reggiani et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2020). However, beyond enabling
comparisons of relative values they are not highly interpretable on
their own (Miller, 2018). For instance, from Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-accessibility}, P1 has lower accessibility than P5
but despite the accessibility value for P1 being relatively low it is
still better than \emph{zero}. To address this interpretability issue,
previous research has aimed to index and normalize values on a per
demand-population basis (e.g., Barboza et al., 2021; Pereira et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2021).

However, as recent research on accessibility discusses (see for instance
Allen and Farber, 2019; Paez et al., 2019), these steps do not address
the bias introduced through the uneven multiple-counting of
opportunities which are unconstrained by demand-side competition. This
is similar to the congestion effect that floating catchment area methods
aim to address, although they do not necessarily solve the issue
completely (see Paez et al., 2019). The underlying issue arises as a
result of the underlying assumption that for conventional accessibility
\(A_i\) all opportunities for all origins \(i=1,\cdots,n\) are
\emph{available} to any one who can reach them: in other words, they are
assumed to be divisible and non-competitive. This results in every
opportunity entering the weighted sum once for every origin \(i\) that
can reach it. Put another way, if a densely populated population center
pops up next to P5 this center too will have a high accessibility score
since \(A_i\) does not consider competition of opportunities from
neighbouring population centers. Neglecting to constrain opportunity
counts (i.e., single-constraint) obscures the interpretability of
accessibility which can bias results in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Demand centers in the less dense outer limits of the urban core may be
  assigned disproportionately \emph{high} accessibility values. These
  periphery areas are traditionally located in proximity to more dense
  urban demand centers and large urban opportunity centers and thus may
  have low travel cost to these large opportunity centers. Accessibility
  \(A_i\) does not consider opportunity-constraints and, as such, these
  periphery demand centers benefit from the high accessibility to
  opportunities without competition considerations from their more dense
  and more centrally located neighbours.
\item
  Remote areas which are still within the region of the analysis and
  have regionally-relative low demand centers, opportunity centers, and
  travel costs to opportunity centers, are assigned disproportionately
  \emph{low} accessibility values. These more remote areas may be
  sufficiently supplied with opportunities proportionate to their demand
  but this relationship is obscured by the artificially high
  accessibility awarded to demand- and opportunity-rich areas in which
  competition disproportionately occurs.
\end{enumerate}

The spatially uneven multiple-counting of opportunities (i.e., the
competition effect) leave decision makers unclear on how to interpret
resulting accessibility estimates. All recent accessibility measures
which seek to improve interpretability are either vulnerable to this
impact or require potentially unrealistic assumptions. As previously
mentioned, the floating catchment areas (FCA) method increases
interpretability by purporting to account for competition, however, as
discussed by Paez et al. (2019), FCA methods are vulnerable to a similar
multiple-counting effect. On this same note, the doubly-constrained
gravity model proposed by Allen and Farber (2019) which is based on the
FCA method, accounts for competition, but requires that the magnitude of
demand matches the opportunities or be re-scaled to match. As already
noted, this assumption is not always realistic for many opportunity
types such as in the case of job seekers and jobs.

To address the competition effect and introduce a more realistic
assumption regarding non-divisible opportunities, we propose a
singly-constrained gravity measure called \textbf{spatial availability}.
This measure seeks to answer the following questions for an individual
at a specific demand center: \emph{``many opportunities are accessible,
but the same opportunities are also accessible to my (possibly) numerous
neighbours\ldots{} what does a high accessibility actually mean to
me?''} and \emph{``a few opportunities are accessible to me but I am
located in a remote area with proportionally few neighbours relative to
the region\ldots{} what does low accessibility mean to me?''}. Beyond
the individual, spatial availability, can also be used as-is to evaluate
the \emph{spatial mismatch} of accessible opportunities and
demand-seeking population within regions and between regions.

\hypertarget{analytical-framework}{%
\section{Analytical framework}\label{analytical-framework}}

Formally, spatial availability \(V_{ij}\) is defined by opportunities
\(O\) which are proportionally allocated based on a population
allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) and cost of travel allocation factor
\(F^c_{ij}\) for all origins \(i\) to all destinations \(j\) as detailed
in Equation (\ref{eq:spatial-availability}). In line with the tradition
of gravity modeling, the proposed framework distinguishes between
opportunities at a destination and demand for opportunities at the
origin.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spatial-availability}
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^K F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(V_{ij}\) is spatial availability.
\item
  \(i\) is a set of origin locations in the region \(K\).
\item
  \(j\) is a set of destination locations in the region \(K\).
\item
  \(O_j\) is the number of opportunities at location \(j\) in the region
  \(K\).
\item
  \(F^p_{ij}\) is the proportional allocation factor of the population
  in \(i\) relative to the population in region \(K\).
\item
  \(F^c_{ij}\) is the proportion allocation factor of travel cost for
  \(i\) relative to the travel cost in region \(K\); it is a product of
  a monotonically decreasing (i.e., impedance) function associated with
  the cost of travel between \(i\) and \(j\).
\end{itemize}

Since spatial availability \(V_{ij}\) consists of these two allocation
factors, we detail the role of population allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\)
in producing \(V^p_{ij}\), the role of the travel cost allocation factor
\(F^c_{ij}\) in producing \(V^c_{ij}\), and finally how both allocation
factors in the final general form of spatial availability \(V_{ij}\) are
combined. The calculation of spatial availability is introduced with a
step-by-step example for two population centers (\(P_2\) and \(P_3\)) in
the role of demand (i.e., the number of individuals in the labour market
who `demand' employment) and one employment center (\(O_1\)) in the role
of opportunities.

\hypertarget{population-and-travel-cost-allocation-factors}{%
\subsubsection{Population and travel cost allocation
factors}\label{population-and-travel-cost-allocation-factors}}

We begin with allocation based on demand; consider an employment center
\(j\) with \(O_j^r\) jobs of type \(r\). In the general case where there
are \(K\) population centers in the region, the following factor can be
defined in Equation (\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor}
F^p_{ij} = \frac{P_{i\in r}^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^K P_{i\in r}^\alpha}
\end{equation}

The population allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) corresponds to the
proportion of the population in origin \(i\) relative to the rest of the
region's population centres \(K\). On the right hand side of the
equation, the numerator \(P_{i\in r}\) is the population at origin \(i\)
that is eligible and `demand' jobs of type \(r\) (e.g., those with a
certain level of training or in a designated age group, etc.). The
summation in the denominator is over \(i=1,\cdots,K\), the number of
population at all origins \(i\) in the region \(K\). To modulate the
effect of the size in from this factor we also add an empirical
parameter \(\alpha\) (i.e., \(\alpha <1\) places greater weight on
smaller centres relative to larger ones while \(\alpha>1\) achieves the
opposite effect). This population allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) can now
be used to proportionally allocate a share of the jobs at a destination
\(j\) to all origin pairs.

More broadly, since the factor \(F^p_{ij}\) is a proportion, when it is
summed over \(i=1,\cdots,K\) it always equals to 1 (i.e.,
\(\sum_i^{K} F^p_{ij} = 1\)). This is notable since the share of jobs
(the spatial availability based on population \(V^p_{ij}\)) at each
destination \(j\) allocated to (i.e., available to) each origin is equal
to \(V^p_{ij} = O_j \cdot F^p_{ij}\) and since the sum of \(F^p_{ij}\)
is equal to 1 it follows that \(\sum_{i=1}^I V_{ij} = O_j\). In other
words, the number of jobs across the region is preserved. The result is
a proportional allocation of jobs (opportunities) to origins based on
population demand; this factor does not consider travel cost, that is
defined in the travel cost allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) which is
introduced shortly.

To illustrate the population allocation factor, consider an employment
center has 300 jobs (\(O_1= 300\)) in a region with two population
centers which have 240 and 120 people, respectively (\(P_2= 240\) and
\(P_3 = 120\)). This example is different than the synthetic example
presented above. For simplicity, assume that all the population in the
region is eligible for these jobs, that is, that the entirety of the
population is included in the set \(r\). Also assume that \(\alpha=1\)
meaning the only impact on value is the population size for each center.
The population allocation factors \(F^p_{ij}\) for the jobs at \(O_1\)
for each population center \(P_2\) and \(P_3\) would be defined as shown
in Equation (\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
F^p_{2,1} = \frac{P_2 ^\alpha}{P_2^\alpha + P_3^\alpha} = \frac{240}{240 + 120} = \frac{240}{360}\\
F^p_{3,1} = \frac{P_3^\alpha}{P_2^\alpha + P_3^\alpha}  = \frac{120}{240 + 120} = \frac{120}{360}\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The \(F^p_{ij}\) values can be used to find a \emph{partial} spatial
availability of jobs which is only defined by the relative population
demanding jobs; this partial spatial availability \(V^p_{ij}\) for each
population center is calculated as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:pop-alloc-factor-SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pop-alloc-factor-SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V^p_{2,1} = O_1 \cdot F^p_{2,1} = 300 \cdot \frac{240}{360} = 200 \\
V^p_{3,1} = O_1 \cdot F^p_{3,1} = 300 \cdot \frac{120}{360} = 100 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

When using only the proportional allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) to
calculate spatial availability (differentiated here by being defined as
\(V^p_{ij}\) instead of \(V_{ij}\)), proportionally more jobs are
allocated to the bigger population center (i.e., 2 times more jobs as it
is 2 times larger in population). We can also see that the sum of
spatial availability for all population centers is equal to the sum of
jobs, i.e., total opportunities are preserved. However, as mentioned,
using only the proportional allocation factor \(F^p_{ij}\) to calculate
spatial availability does not account for how far population centers
\(P_2\) or \(P_3\) are from employment center \(O_1\). To account for
this effect, we introduce a second allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) based
on distance to the employment centers defined in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-alloc-factor}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-alloc-factor}
F^c_{ij} = \frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_{i=1}^K f(c_{ij})}\\
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(c_{ij}\) is the cost (e.g., the distance, travel time,
etc.) from population center \(i\) to employment center \(j\), and
\(f(\cdot)\) is an impedance function that is a monotonically decreasing
function of cost (\(c_{ij}\)); in other words, the travel cost
allocation factor \(F^c_{ij}\) serves to proportionally allocate more
jobs to closer locations through an impedance function. To continue
illustrating, assume that the impedance function is a negative
exponential function. Next, assume the parameter \(\beta\) modulates the
steepness of the impedance effect and is empirically determined in the
case of positive accessibility, or set by the analyst to meet a preset
condition in the case of normative accessibility (Paez et al., 2012).
For the sake of the example, we set a value of 1. Also suppose that the
distance from population center \(P_2\) to employment center \(O_1\) is
0.6 km, and the distance from population center \(P_3\) to employment
center \(O_1\) is 0.3 km. The proportional allocation factor
\(F^p_{ij}\) for the jobs at \(O_1\) for both population centers \(P_2\)
and \(P_3\) is defined as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
F^c_{2,1} = \frac{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1})}{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1}) + \exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})} = \frac{\exp(-0.6)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 0.426\\
F^c_{3,1} = \frac{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})}{\exp(-\beta \cdot D_{2,1}) + \exp(-\beta \cdot D_{3,1})}  = \frac{\exp(-0.3)}{\exp(-0.6) + \exp(-0.3)} = 0.574\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

We can see that the proportional allocation factor for \(P_3\) is larger
than \(P_2\) since the cost (i.e., distance) to \(O_1\) is shorter.
Using the travel cost proportional allocation factors \(F^c_{ij}\) as
defined in Equation (\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-2populations}), we
can now calculate the spatial availability of jobs for each population
center based only on \(F^c_{ij}\) and the jobs available \(O_1\) to
these two competing population centers (note: \(V^c_{ij}\) not the
complete \(V_{ij}\)) as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcost-allocation-factor-SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V^c_{2,1} = O_1 \cdot F^c_{2,1} = 300 \times 0.426 = 127.8\\
V^c_{3,1} = O_1 \cdot F^c_{3,1} = 300 \times  0.574 = 172.2\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

As shown, the spatial availability defined by \(F^c_{ij}\) (i.e.,
\(V^c_{ij}\)) allocates \(P_3\) a larger share of jobs since the
population center is closer to \(O_1\). However, as previously
discussed, \(P_3\) has a smaller population than \(P_2\), so \(P_2\)
receives a larger share of jobs when spatial availability when it is
defined by \(F^p_{ij}\) (i.e., \(V^p_{ij}\)). It is necessary to combine
population and travel cost components into spatial interaction models to
better reflect demand. These two components are in line with how demand
is conventionally modelled in accessibility calculations, namely, by
re-scaling on a per demand-population basis or considering competition
effects (e.g., Allen and Farber, 2019; Barboza et al., 2021; Yang et
al., 2006). Fortunately, since both \(F^c_{ij}\) and \(F^p_{ij}\)
preserve the total number of opportunities (jobs) as they independently
sum to 1, they can be combined multiplicatively to calculate the
proposed spatial availability (\(V_{ij}\)) which considers demand to be
based on both population and travel cost.

\hypertarget{putting-spatial-availability-together}{%
\subsubsection{Putting spatial availability
together}\label{putting-spatial-availability-together}}

We can combine the proportional allocation factors by population
\(F^p_{ij}\) and travel cost \(F^c_{ij}\) and calculate spatial
availability \(V_{ij}\) as introduced in Equation
(\ref{eq:spatial-availability}) and repeated below:

\[
V_{ij} = O_j\frac{F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^K F^p_{ij} \cdot F^c_{ij}}
\]

To complete the illustrative example of employment center \(O_1\) and
population centers \(P_2\) and \(P_3\), the resulting spatial
availability \(V_{ij}\) is calculated for both population centers is
calculated in Equation (\ref{eq:SA-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
V_{2,1} = O_1\cdot \frac{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1}}{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1} + F^p_{3,1} \cdot F^c_{3,1}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)} = 179.4\\
V_{3,1} = O_1\cdot \frac{F^p_{3,1} \cdot F^c_{3,1}}{F^p_{2,1} \cdot F^c_{2,1} + F^p_{ik} \cdot F^c_{ik}} = 300 \frac{\big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}{\big(\frac{2}{3} \big) \big(0.426 \big) + \big(\frac{1}{3} \big) \big(0.574 \big)}  =  120.6 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

From the resulting values we can see, fewer jobs are allocated to
population center \(P_2\) compared to the allocation by population only,
to account for the higher cost of reaching the employment center. On the
other hand, distance alone allocated more jobs to the closest population
center (i.e., \(P_3\)), but since it is smaller, it also gets a smaller
share of the jobs overall. To reiterate, the sum of jobs at employment
center \(O_1\) that are allocated to population centers \(P_2\) and
\(P_3\) simultaneously based on \emph{population-} and \emph{travel
cost} allocation factors are preserved (i.e.,
\(V_{2,1} + V_{3,1} = O_1\)).

In the common case that population centers have multiple destination
opportunities \(j\), spatial availability is simply the sum of Equation
(\ref{eq:spatial-availability}) for all opportunities \(J\) (i.e.,
\(V_i = \sum_{j=1}^J V_{ij}\)). The resulting value of \(V_i\)
represents opportunities (e.g., jobs) that can be accessed from origin
\(i\) and that are \emph{not} allocated to any other competing origin:
\(V_i\) is thus the weighted sum of available opportunities and is the
\emph{opportunity access} for that origin \(i\) considering constrained
opportunity availability. When comparing \(V_i\) to the
singly-constrained gravity model (see Wilson (1971)), \(V_i\) is the
result of constraining \(A_i\) to match one of the marginals in the
origin-destination table, the known total of opportunities.

Since the sum of opportunities is preserved in the procedures above, it
is possible to calculate a highly interpretable measure of spatial
availability per capita (lower-case \(v_i\)) as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:SA-per-capita}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-per-capita}
v_i = \frac{V_i}{P_i}
\end{equation}

To complete the illustrative example, the per capita spatial
availability of jobs would be calculated as follows in Equation
(\ref{eq:SA-per-capita-2populations}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA-per-capita-2populations}
\begin{array}{l}\
v_{2,1} = \frac{V_{2,1}}{P_2} =  \frac{179.4}{240} = 0.8\\
v_{3,1} =  \frac{V_{3,1}}{P_3} =  \frac{120.6}{120} = 1.0\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

From the resulting values we can see that since \(P_3\) is closer to
\(O_1\) and has less competition (as it has a smaller population than
\(P_2\)), \(P_3\) benefits with a higher spatial availability of jobs
per job-seeking population. We can also compare these values to the
overall ratio of jobs-to-population in this region of one job center and
two population centers is \(300/(240 + 120)=\) 0.83.

\section{Empirical data set: measuring spatial availability and
accessibility of jobs in the
GGH}\label{empirical-data-set-measuring-spatial-availability-and-accessibility-of-jobs-in-the-ggh}}

Two scales of analysis using an empirical data set of home-based work
trips is used in this section. The first example demonstrates how
accessibility broadly overestimates \emph{job access} (relative to
spatial availability) and particularly overestimates job access for
areas in the less dense outer limits of the urban core. The second
example demonstrates how accessibility underestimates job access for
areas in the urban periphery. We first introduce the data used, then
calibrate the impedance function, and finally visualize the two scales
of analysis

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The home-based work trips from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey
(TTS) area is retained; the TTS collects representative urban travel
information from 20 municipalities contained within the GGH area in the
southern part of Ontario, Canada (see Figure
\ref{fig:TTS-16-survey-area}) (Data Management Group, 2018). These
home-based work trips include origins and employment destinations
defined by centroids of Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ) (n=3,764), the
number of jobs (n=3,081,885) and workers (n=3,446,957) at each origin
and destination, and the number trips from origin to destination for the
morning home-to-work commute (n=3,446,957). The TTS data is based on a
representative sample of between 3\% to 5\% of households in the GGH and
is weighted to reflect the population covering the study area has a
whole (Data Management Group, 2018).

To generate the travel cost for these trips, travel times between
origins and destinations are calculated for car travel using the R
package \{r5r\} (Rafael H. M. Pereira et al., 2021) with a street
network retrieved from OpenStreetMap for the GGH area. Travel times
based on car travel alone are unrealistic, since we know a significant
proportion of trips are taken by non-car modes. Moreover, this method
does not account for traffic congestion. Though modal split and travel
times can be estimated through other methods (e.g., Allen and Farber,
2021; Higgins et al., 2021), for simplicity, we carry on with the
assumption that all trips are taken by car in uncongested travel
conditions.

All data and data preparation steps can be freely explored in companion
open data product

\hypertarget{calibrating-an-impedance-function}{%
\subsection{Calibrating an impedance
function}\label{calibrating-an-impedance-function}}

In the synthetic example introduced in a preceding section, an arbitrary
negative exponential function describing travel cost (as a function of
distance) was used as the impedance function. In this TTS work commute
example, an impedance function is calibrated based on the trip length
distribution (TLD). For background, a TLD is the representation of the
likelihood that a proportion of trips are taken at a specific travel
cost (e.g., travel time); this distribution is commonly used to derive
impedance functions in accessibility research (Batista et al., 2019;
Horbachov and Svichynskyi, 2018).

The empirical and theoretical TLD for this data set are represented in
the top-left panel of Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}. Maximum
likelihood estimation and the Nelder-Mead method for direct optimization
available within the \{fitdistrplus\} package (Delignette-Muller and
Dutang, 2015) were used. Based on goodness-of-fit criteria and
diagnostics seen in Figure \ref{fig:TLD-Gamma-plot}, the gamma
distribution was selected (also see Figure \ref{fig:plot-cullen-frey} in
the Appendix).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

The gamma distribution-based impedance function takes the following
general form where the estimated `shape' is \(\alpha=\) 2.019, the
estimated `rate' is \(\beta =\) 0.094, and \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is defined
in Equation (\ref{gamma-dist}).

\begin{equation}
\label{gamma-dist}
\begin{array}{l}\ 
f(x, \alpha, \beta) = \frac {x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}}{ \beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq \infty\\

\Gamma(\alpha) =  \int_{0}^{\infty} x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x} \,dx\\

\end{equation}

\hypertarget{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-the-ggh}{%
\subsection{Measuring access to jobs in the
GGH}\label{measuring-access-to-jobs-in-the-ggh}}

Toronto is the largest city in the GGH and represents a significant
subset of workers and jobs in the GGH; 51\% of workers in the GGH travel
to jobs in Toronto and 73\% of jobs are located within Toronto. As will
be discussed, when accessibility and spatial availability values are
compared, this significant subset of jobs in Toronto contributes to both
issues associated with the competition effect. Specifically, since
accessibility does not include the single-opportunity constraint like
spatial availability does, accessibility \emph{overestimates} job access
for most TAZs in proximity to Toronto (i.e., GTA) and contributes to the
\emph{underestimation} of job access for TAZs in the periphery of the
GGH.

Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS} presents the accessibility and
spatial availability for the full TTS data set. Within the accessibility
plot, job access values follow a radial trend where a few TAZ with a
high values are strictly located within the boundaries of Toronto and
values radially decrease further from the boundaries of Toronto. This
general trend is echoed in qualitative studies which find the further
from Toronto, the longer the employment commute (Axisa et al., 2012) and
the closer to core of Toronto, the more opportunities are accessible
(for some to certain types of jobs: Páez et al. (2013)).

Conversely, competitive job access is calculated using the spatial
availability measure and is presented alongside the accessibility plot
in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}. Similar to the accessibility
plot, the higher the value, the more access that TAZ has to jobs in the
GGH. Since spatial availability constrains the total number of
opportunities, higher values of spatial availability can be interpreted
as higher access to \emph{available} jobs (i.e., competitive job
access). We can observe which TAZs have spatial availability values that
are above or below the regional average of 642. It is worth noting that
the spatial availability and accessibility plots do not follow the same
spatial distribution. Within the spatial availability plot, job access
appears more evenly assigned throughout the GGH. Particularly, job
access values, as measured by spatial availability, are higher around
the north east and south west periphery TAZs and more moderate in and
around Toronto than compared to accessibility.

Note that in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS} it can be observed
that a few TAZ are greyed out; this corresponds to a null accessibility
and spatial availability. Overall, 22\% of TAZ are greyed out as a
result of containing zero home-to-work GGH trips and as such are
allocated a null accessibility and spatial availability. The majority of
these no-trip TAZ because they contain no worker population,
specifically, 95\% have zero workers while only 18\% of these TAZ have
zero jobs (17\% have both zero workers and jobs).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}Calculated accessibility (top) and spatial availability (bottom) of employment from origins in the GGH to destinations in the GGH. Greyed out TAZs represent null accessibility and spatial availability values .}\label{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}
\end{figure}

\newpage

To enhance the interpretability of spatial availability, the measure can
be normalized to provide more meaningful insight into how many jobs are
\emph{available} on average for each TAZ. This normalization, shown in
Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-GGH-TTS-per-worker}, demonstrates which TAZ
have above (reds) and below (blue) the average ( available jobs per
worker in the GGH. Similar to the spatial availability plot of the GGH
jobs in Figure \ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}, we can see that many
average or above average jobs per worker TAZ (whites and reds) are
present in southern Peel and Halton (south-west of Toronto), Waterloo
and Brantford (even more south-west of Toronto), and Hamilton and
Niagara (south of Toronto), however, the distribution is uneven and many
TAZ within these areas do have below average values (blues).

Interestingly, when considering \emph{competitive} job access, many
areas outside of Toronto have similar jobs per worker values as TAZ in
Toronto. This is contrary to the notion that since Toronto has high job
access it has a significant density of employment opportunities in the
GGH. Not all jobs in Toronto are \emph{available} since Toronto has a
high density of \emph{competition} in addition to density of jobs
opportunities. For instance, urban centers outside of Toronto such as
those found in Brantford, Guelph, southern Peel, Halton, and Niagara
have TAZ which are far above the the TTS average jobs per worker and
higher than TAZ within Toronto. High job access is not seen in the
accessibility plot which suggests that these less densely populated
urban centers may have sufficient employment opportunities for their
populations; This finding is obscured when only considering the
accessibility measure for job access as will be later discussed.

It is also worth noting that there is almost two times more jobs per
worker in the GGH jobs spatial availability results than the GGH Toronto
spatial availability results. This suggests that all GGH people who work
in the city of Toronto, on average, face more competition for jobs than
all GGH people who work anywhere in the GGH .

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In the preceding section we used both accessibility and spatial
availability to explore the job access landscape in the GGH. To build on
the findings, we return to the two issues associated with the
accessibility \(A_i\) measure. As we described, accessibility has the
tendency to overestimate job access for areas which may experience high
competition (issue 1) and underestimate job access for areas with low
competition (issue 2).

To compare both accessibility and spatial availability, we calculate
their relative magnitudes by re-scaling both measures from 0 to 100
where each value of the measure is divided by the maximum value as
described in Equation \ref{eq:index-measures} by \(A^I_{ij}\) and
\(V^I_{ij}\). Re-scaling is repeated for both measures and the
proportional difference between the measures is calculated as described
in Equation \ref{eq:dif-index-measures}. This difference represents how
many times over- or under- estimated job access is for a TAZ when
measured by the re-scaled accessibility relative to the re-scaled
spatial availability (e.g., accessibility is X times \emph{larger} than
spatial availability thus job access is \emph{overestimated} when using
the accessibility measure compared to the spatial availability measure).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:index-measures}
\begin{array}{l}\
A^I_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\max(A_{ij})}\cdot100\\
V^I_{ij} = \frac{V_{ij}}{\max(V_{ij})}\cdot100\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dif-index-measures}
Dif_{ij} = \frac{A^I_{ij}}{V^I_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Accessibility's role in overestimating and underestimating
jobs
access}\label{accessibilitys-role-in-overestimating-and-underestimating-jobs-access}}

Here we demonstrate the difference between the two job access values for
the full data set, namely, all jobs within the GGH and all workers
within the GGH. While the majority of TAZ have difference values which
correspond to accessibility being overestimated relative to spatial
availability, 83\% of TAZ are underestimated.

The overestimated TAZ have a median difference of 4.43 which indicates
that the median accessibility value over-estimates the median spatial
availability by 4.43 times. The overestimate difference ranges between 1
to 1889 with an upper quartile value (75\%) of 10.54. It should be noted
that these TAZ with an upper 95\% of difference values (69 to 1889) are
a result of high competition and/or high multiple-counting of
opportunities; They contain exceptionally low spatial availability
values and relatively high accessibility values.

Conversely, a few TAZ are underestimated and are plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH} alongside the overestimated TAZ for
comparison. Of the underestimated TAZ, the median spatial availability
value is 0.605 indicating that the median accessibility is 0.605 the
spatial availability value. The difference values ranges between 0.006
to 0.995.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/plot-difference-GGH-1} \caption{\label{fig:plot-difference-GGH}Overestimated (top) and underestimated (bottom) differences between the re-scaled accessibility and spatial availability job access measures in the context of employment from all origins and destinations in the GGH. Values are expressed in five quantile ranges. Greyed TAZs have values which are underestimated in the top plot and are overestimated in the bottom plot. TAZs with no trips and thus no spatial availability or accessibility values are not drawn.}\label{fig:plot-difference-GGH}
\end{figure}

As observed from the top plot in Figure \ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH},
the TAZ with overestimated job access are coloured in varying shades of
red. TAZ with the highest degree of overestimation (darkest reds) are
concentrated within Toronto and the periphery of the GTA. Differences
between the number of workers and travel time partially explain the
overestimation, with TAZs that have a lower number of workers and higher
travel time having a larger overestimation. Specifically, the
correlations between workers and overestimation, and travel time and
overestimation is -0.17 and 0.13 respectively.

Nonetheless, the TAZ-specific density of workers and travel time does
not fully explain the variation in overestimation; the number of
opportunities and the value of these variables in neighbouring TAZ also
factor into the calculation for both measures. From the perspective of
accessibility, since opportunity-constraints are not considered, the
\emph{overestimated} TAZ (relative to spatial availability) are awarded
higher values since they are more centrally located to opportunities
(i.e., low travel cost) and are not discounted from being in proximity
to highly competitive TAZ (i.e., high density of workers). On the other
hand, spatial availability considers this competition by proportionally
allocating jobs to TAZ relative to their travel cost and worker
population. In other words, TAZ appears \emph{overestimated} when the
impact of travel cost alone outpaces the impact of both travel cost and
workers thus the proportional allocation of opportunity results in a
significantly smaller job access than the resulting value for
accessibility. This may explain why TAZ which are exceptionally
overestimated (dark reds) are on the periphery of more densely populated
urban cities. These TAZ are located far enough away from workers in
densely populated TAZ but still relatively close enough to jobs in
Toronto. As such, their high accessibility value is a result of counting
many more opportunities than the single-constrained spatial availability
proportionally allocates.

Since both measures account for values contained in neighbouring TAZ
differently (i.e., unconstrained or competition-constraint),
correlations between TAZ-specific variables evidently cannot fully
explain differences between variables. As such, the exploration of ways
in which the number of workers, opportunities, and travel times in
neighboring TAZ as well as within TAZs impact the two measures is out of
scope for this paper and will be detailed in future analysis. However,
within the scope of this paper, it can be stated that TAZs that are
overestimated have relatively high job access when calculated using
accessibility as a result of result of unconstrained multiple-counting
of jobs and have relatively low job access as measured by spatial
availability due to worker competition.

Turning to the bottom plot in Figure \ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}, TAZ
with underestimated job access (i.e., re-scaled accessibility values are
smaller than re-scaled spatial availability values) are located on the
periphery of the GGH area. The majority of these underestimated TAZ are
not within the center of the GGH where the GTA is located but are in
proximity to other, smaller, employment areas within smaller
municipalities. It can be understood that the underestimation of TAZ is
a result of both high spatial availability as a result of low job
competition and low accessibility scores that are a by-product of the
job multiple-counting occurring within more densely job-populated TAZ in
the GTA. Accessibility's multiple-counting effectively deflates the job
access in these peripheral TAZ since their accessibility values are
significantly lower compared to their multiple-counted GTA TAZ
neighbours. The impact of this multiple-counting is starkly apparent
when compared to the re-scaled spatial availability measure since
spatial availability allocates jobs proportionally based on workers and
travel cost, TAZ do not multiple-counting of jobs and TAZ which are not
in the position to multiple-count are not deflated as a consequence.
This is supported by viewing the spatial availability of jobs per worker
(Figure \ref{fig:plot-avail-GGH-TTS-per-worker}) where we can see that
commercial areas throughout the GGH area have similar job access values
as within some commercial areas in the GTA; this is not the case for the
accessibility measure (see trends in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-access-SA-GGH-TTS}).

GGH}\label{comparing-differences-in-job-access-when-only-considering-toronto-jobs-in-the-ggh}}

Next, we present two final difference plots in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-diff-Toronto-vs-GGH} as a point of comparison; included is
a consolidated plot of those included in Figure
\ref{fig:plot-diff-Toronto-vs-GGH} and another plot calculated only
using the subset of jobs in Toronto (i.e., all workers in the GGH who
travel to work in a Toronto-located job). This subset of jobs is
significant but are concentrated in Toronto, which is spatially a small
portion of the whole GGH. Specifically, 51\% of workers in the GGH
travel to jobs in Toronto and 73\% of jobs are located within Toronto.
It can be observed, that when subseting the analysis to \emph{only}
include Toronto jobs, almost all TAZ are overestimated (i.e.,
accessibility is larger than spatial availability). Notably, we can see
virtually all \emph{underestimation} disappears (blues) and the TAZs in
the GHG periphery are now all overestimated (reds).

When inspecting the results for the subset of jobs in Toronto and
comparing it to the results of the GGH periphery TAZ within the full GGH
analysis, the effect of the single-constraint of the spatial
availability measure is evident. Looking at the GGH peripheral TAZ in
the left plot (Figure \ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}), these TAZ have
relatively low spatial availability as they experience moderately high
job competition since they have relatively high travel times to jobs in
Toronto and have a moderately low worker population. Similarly, these
peripheral TAZ also have relatively low accessibility (compared to the
region) as a result of the multiple-counting which occurs within and
around the high density of jobs in Toronto. However, when spatial
availability and accessibility are compared, accessibility is still
\emph{higher} than spatial availability thus the difference appears
\emph{overestimated} (red).

Interestingly, the difference in the two measures flips when the workers
who work in areas outside of Toronto are re-introduced to these
peripheral TAZ as represented in right plot (Figure
\ref{fig:plot-difference-GGH}). Since more workers (more competition)
and more jobs with lower travel costs (less competition) are introduced,
it can be inferred that these peripheral TAZ experience moderately
higher job access as measured with spatial availability. Conversely, for
the accessibility measure, the introduction of additional workers does
not meter the accessibility gained by the introduction of additional
jobs and as such, the re-scaled accessibility values are \emph{higher}
than the spatial availability resulting in underestimated TAZ.

As such, we see that when including all the jobs in the region back into
the analysis - these periphery TAZ are much less \emph{job deprived}
when measured using spatial availabily than when measuring using
accessibility. Overall, within the full set of jobs in the GGH, the
first and second issue associated with accessibility's competition
effect are observed.

\hypertarget{other-use-cases-of-spatial-availability}{%
\section{Other use cases of spatial
availability}\label{other-use-cases-of-spatial-availability}}

In addition to measuring access to jobs for workers, spatial
availability can be used to measure many other opportunity types and
scenarios. In this section we demonstrate two additional ways in which
spatial availability can be applied. Since spatial availability
singly-constraints opportunities which are allocated to the demand
seeking population, opportunities or demand seeking populations can be
subset while the resulting access measure does not lose any
interpretability. As such, we firstly present a practical application is
calculating job access for a specialized subset of population to
specialized employment centers. We then present an application where the
roles of workers and employers are reversed and employers are the demand
seeking population. These two additional use cases are non-exhaustive
and applications outside of employment are tenable and warranted.

To illustrate these two additional examples, we return to the synthetic
example initially introduced in Background section.

\hypertarget{specialized-employment-opportunities}{%
\subsection{Specialized employment
opportunities}\label{specialized-employment-opportunities}}

Suppose that population centers P1 through P8 are not all eligible for
employment at the three employment centers E1, E2, and E3. This can be
due to education attainment or more simply a geographic barrier (i.e.,
river without a road) making it impossible for certain populations to be
employed at certain employment centers. In this synthetic example, we
consider that only population center P1 and P2 are eligible for
employment at employment center E1. Next assume that jobs in employment
center E2 can be taken by individuals in population centers P3, P4, P5,
P7, and P8. Lastly, jobs in employment center E3 require qualifications
available only among individuals in population centers P5, P6, P8, and
P9. In essence, eligibility criteria create catchments which can be
easily considered within the spatial availability measure and this
specialized job access is presented in Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-with-catchments-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}Spatial availability of jobs from population centers assuming catchment restrictions (r) for the simple synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-with-catchments}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita} Spatial availability of jobs per capita for each population centers with catchment restrictions (r) (top) and without catchment restrictions (bottom) for the synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}
\end{figure}

For higher interpretability, we can view Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita} which demonstrates a
plot of spatial availability per captia considering catchments and also
another plot which assumes the same number of employment center
opportunities and population but no catchments.

In the bottom plot of Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}, we see that
population center P5 has the highest level of spatial availability, due
to being a large population center that is more relatively close to
jobs. We also see population centers which are further from employment
centers have low spatial availability (P1, P3, P6, P7, P9) and
population centers which are more central have, evidently, higher job
access. We can also discern that the regional spatial availability per
capita is 0.908. In contrast, when catchments are introduced, as shown
in the top plot of Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-jobs-per-capita}, we see that the job
access for population centers in the blue catchment decreases as job
competition increases. However, we also observe that access marginally
increases for the population centers in the yellow catchment and the
regional spatial availability per capita increases slightly to 0.964.

\hypertarget{spatial-availability-of-labor-pool}{%
\subsection{Spatial availability of labor
pool}\label{spatial-availability-of-labor-pool}}

In this use case, we remove the catchments and switch the demand and
opportunity roles of the employment centers and population centers. In
this way, the spatial availability measure reflects \emph{worker access}
by proportionally allocating \emph{workers} to employment centers based
on travel cost (i.e., distance) and population (i.e., jobs at each
employment center). Figure
\ref{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job} presents spatial
availability generally and per capita for this use case.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Spatial-Availability_files/figure-latex/toy-example-availability-workers-per-job-1} \caption{\label{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job} Spatial availability of workers for each employment center (top) and the spatial availability of workers per job for each employment center (bottom) for the simple synthetic example}\label{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:toy-example-availability-workers-per-job},
the top plot demonstrates the spatial availability which measures
\emph{worker access} for the three employment centers. As with all
spatial availability calculations, the number of all opportunities (in
this case \emph{workers}) are proportionally allocated to each
employment center so employment center E3, E2 and E1 have access to
2205.19, 1709.52, and 610.29 workers respectively. Again, this totals to
4500 workers in the area. In the bottom plot, these spatial availability
values are normalized per job (i.e.~the `population' of the employment
centers) and we can see that employment center E3 has an above average
worker access of 1.47 workers per job while E2 and E1 have 0.76 and 0.81
workers per job respectively.

\hypertarget{concluding-remarks-and-future-applications}{%
\section{Concluding remarks and future
applications}\label{concluding-remarks-and-future-applications}}

In this paper, we propose \emph{spatial availability} as an alternative
to conventional accessibility which measures opportunity access which
addressed the \emph{competition effect} and thus produces a meaningful
opportunity access measure which can be normalized per demand population
and used to compare access across regions. As a reminder, the
competition effect results in the over- and under- estimation of
opportunity access, under specific conditions, due to the
multiple-counting of opportunities which is embedded in accessibility's
method and thus makes comparing accessibility across regions potentially
biased . Spatial availability, however, proportionally allocates
opportunities based on the demand population and travel cost thus
constraining the number of opportunities allocated across the measured
region to the number of opportunities available. This single-sided
opportunity constraint can be said to only consider opportunity
competition for any magnitude of demand population (i.e., when measuring
job access per worker the number of workers (demanding population) does
not need to match the number of jobs (opportunities)). We demonstrate
the use of this measure and how it compares with accessibility in an
empirical example of workers and jobs in the GGH. We also demonstrate
two additional employment use cases for this versatile measure in a
hypothetical synthetic example. These data sets and examples highlight
how intuitive the per demand population access values are and captures
some of the extent to which accessibility overestimates and
underestimates access.

We acknowledge recent work to address limitations associated with the
accessibility measure; in this light, we propose that spatial
availability be seen as a type of spatial mismatch and an evolution of
the BFCA approach. Historically, literature has iteratively improved
measures assessing access to opportunities. In the context of employment
and healthcare opportunities, simple container counting solutions such
as the population-to-provider ratio (PPR) for healthcare services and
jobs to housing ratio were implemented. This approach, while straight
forward, is highly susceptible to the modifiable unit area problem
(MUAP). Recognizing this and harnessing the computation power and access
to finer resolution data as it became available, scholars proposed the
next evolution, namely the accessibility measure which is widely used
today and we implemented in our examples for comparison. It partially
addresses the MUAP by considering opportunities outside of the
conventional `containers' which represented opportunities in a census
areas/neighbourhoods by counting opportunities informed by an impedance
function based on travel cost. Our measure, spatial availability,
iterates on the accessibility measure by proportionally allocating
travel cost and population (workers) of origins to opportunities at
destinations. This single-constrained approach ensures that the
population is mutually exclusive in essence replicating the properties
of the self-contained unit which is \emph{not} limited to a zoning
system proposed; the pros of accessibility solution in using the
impedance function and pros of the container solutions.

Fundamentally, accessibility measure's methodology results in the
overestimation or underestimation of opportunity access as a result of
the competition effect. Accessibility does not include factors to bound
the summation so origins, hypothetically, can have infinite opportunity
access. Spatial availability includes a single-sided opportunity
constraint so it can be used to calculate access to any opportunity
type, whether competitive or non-competitive in natural. In this paper,
we only examined access to employment (or access to workers from the
perspective of employment centers), but any opportunities which are
competitive (i.e., a finite number of seats or capacity is available at
any given time) such as schools, hospitals, and other essential services
can be measured. Additionally, opportunities which are non-competitive
in the sense that they have always larger capacities than population can
still benefit from this measure as access will not be over or
underestimated as a result of the competition effect seen in
accessibility; non-competitive opportunities can include large natural
parks and beaches. As such, all access values measured for all
opportunities can benefit from spatial availability measure through the
reduction in competition effect (from accessibility) and a meaningful
per demand population benchmark.
